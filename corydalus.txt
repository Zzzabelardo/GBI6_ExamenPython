TI  - Improving the Performance of Red Organic Light-Emitting Transistors by Utilizing 
      a High-k Organic/Inorganic Bilayer Dielectric.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c07216 [doi]
AB  - Integration of electrical switching and light emission in a single unit makes
      organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs) highly promising multifunctional
      devices for next-generation active-matrix flat-panel displays and related
      applications. Here, high-performance red OLETs are fabricated in a multilayer
      configuration that incorporates a zirconia (ZrOx)/cross-linked poly(vinyl
      alcohol) (C-PVA) bilayer as a dielectric. The developed organic/inorganic bilayer
      dielectric renders high dielectric constant as well as improved
      dielectric/semiconductor interface quality, contributing to enhanced carrier
      mobility and high current density. In addition, an efficient red phosphorescent
      organic emitter doped in a bihost system is employed as the emitting layer for an
      effective exciton formation and light generation. Consequently, our optimized red
      OLETs displayed a high brightness of 16470 cd m(-2) and a peak external quantum
      efficiency of 11.9% under a low gate and source-drain voltage of -24 V. To
      further boost the device performance, an electron-blocking layer is introduced
      for ameliorated charge-carrier balance and hence suppressed exciton-charge
      quenching, which resulted in an improved maximum brightness of 20030 cd m(-2). We
      anticipate that the new device optimization approaches proposed in this work
      would spur further development of efficient OLETs with high brightness and
      curtailed efficiency roll-off.

      Fungus Penicillium sp. SCSIO 41512.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00473 [doi]
AB  - Seven new decahydrofluorene-class alkaloids, pyrrospirones K-Q (1-7), together
      with six known analogues (8-13) were isolated from the marine-derived fungal
      strain Penicillium sp. SCSIO 41512. Their structures were determined by extensive
      spectroscopic analysis, and their absolute configurations were established by
      single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations of
      electronic circular dichroism spectra. Compounds 1 and 3 possess a novel
      decahydrofluorene-class alkaloid skeleton with a 6/5/6/8/5/6/13 and a
      6/5/6/5/6/13 polycyclic system, respectively. Biologically, 13 displayed
      significant inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases CD45,
      TCPTP, SHP1, and PTP1B with IC50 values of 8.1-17.8 muM, and 1, 2, 5, 8-10, 12,
      and 13 showed antibacterial activity against six pathogens. Their
      structure-activity relationship is also discussed.

TI  - Unveiling Interstitial Anionic Electron-Driven Ultrahigh K-Ion Storage Capacity
      in a Novel Two-Dimensional Electride Exemplified by Sc3Si2.
PG  - 7439-7447
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01888 [doi]
AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) electrides, characterized by excess interstitial anionic
      electron (IAE) in a crystalline 2D material, offer promising opportunities for
      the development of electrode materials, in particular in rechargeable metal-ion
      batteries applications. Although a few such potential electride materials have
      been reported, they generally show low metal-ion storage capacity, and the effect
      of IAE on the ion storage performance remains elusive so far. Here we report a
      novel 2D electride, [Sc3Si2](1+).1e(-), with fascinating IAE-driven high alkali
      metal-ion storage capacity. In particular, its K-ion specific capacity can reach 
      up to 1497 mA h g(-1), higher than any previously reported 2D materials-based
      anodes in K-ion batteries (PIBs). The IAE in the [Sc3Si2](1+).1e(-) crystal
      accounts for such high capacity behavior, which can drift away and balance the
      charge on the metal-cation, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the metal-ion
      adsorption and enhancing multilayer-ions adsorption. This proposed IAE-driven
      storage mechanism provides an unprecedented avenue for the future design of high 
      storage capacity electrode materials.

TI  - Core-shell excitation of isoxazole at the C, N, and O K-edges - an experimental
      NEXAFS and theoretical TD-DFT study.
LID - 10.1039/d2cp02366k [doi]
AB  - The near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra of the gas-phase
      isoxazole molecule have been measured by collecting total ion yields at the C, N,
      and O K-edges. The spectral structures have been interpreted using time-dependent
      density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the short-range corrected SRC2-BLYP
      exchange-correlation functional. Experimental and calculated energies of core
      excitations are generally in good agreement, and the nature of observed
      core-excitation transitions has been elucidated. The experimental C 1s, N 1s, and
      O 1s core electron binding energies (CEBEs) have additionally been estimated from
      another yield measurement where the neutral fragments in high-Rydberg (HR) states
      were ionized by the electric field. For comparison, theoretical CEBEs have been
      calculated at the DeltaM06-2X//mixed basis set level. We have also calculated the
      vibrationally resolved spectra pertaining to the lowest C 1s and N 1s
      core-excited roots in the Franck-Condon-Herzberg-Teller (FCHT) approximation.
      These spectra correlate well with the observed spectral features and have proven 
      useful in resolving certain ambiguities in the assignment of the low-lying C 1s
      NEXAFS bands.

TI  - Novel Alzheimer risk factor IQ motif containing protein K is abundantly expressed
      in the brain and is markedly increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 954071
LID - 10.3389/fncel.2022.954071 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and highly heterogeneous. Less than 10% of AD
      cases are early-onset (EOAD) caused by autosomal dominantly inherited mutations
      in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), or presenilin 2 (PS2),
      each of which can increase Abeta generation and, thus, amyloid plaques. The
      remaining 90% of cases of AD are late-onset (LOAD) or sporadic. Intense research 
      efforts have led to identification of many genes that increase the risk of AD. An
      IQ motif containing protein K (IQCK) was recently identified by several
      investigators as an Alzheimer's disease risk gene. However, how IQCK increases AD
      risk is completely unknown. Since IQCK is a novel gene, there is limited
      information on its physiological characterization. To understand its role in AD, 
      it is first important to determine its subcellular localization, whether and
      where it is expressed in the brain, and what type of brain cells express the IQCK
      protein. Therefore, in this study, we show by immunocytochemical (ICC) staining
      that IQCK is expressed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of SH-SY5Y
      neuroblastoma cells as well as HeLa cells but not in either HMC3 microglial or
      CHO cells. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), we also show that IQCK is expressed in 
      both mouse and human neurons, including neuronal processes in vivo in the mouse
      brain. IHC data also show that the IQCK protein is widely expressed throughout
      the mouse brain, although regional differences were noted. IQCK expression was
      highest in the brainstem (BS), followed by the cerebellum (CB) and the cortex
      (CX), and it was lowest in the hippocampus (HP). This finding was consistent with
      data from an immunoblot analysis of brain tissue homogenates. Interestingly, we
      found IQCK expression in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes using
      cell-specific antibodies, but IQCK was not detected in microglial cells,
      consistent with negative in vitro results in HMC3 cells. Most importantly, we
      found that actin-normalized IQCK protein levels were increased by 2 folds in AD
      brains relative to normal control (NC) brains. Furthermore, the IQCK protein was 
      found in amyloid plaques, suggesting that IQCK may play a pathogenic role in
      either Abeta generation or amyloid plaque deposition in AD.

      of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
PG  - 905191
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.905191 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is known to be an endocrine
      state that is characterized by oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and highly
      cystic follicles in the ovaries. The use of food ingredients and traditional
      medicine in Asian countries is well known, and previous studies have shown that
      Ecklonia cava K. [Alariaceae] (EC) is able to alleviate PCOS symptoms.
      D-Chiro-inositol (DCI) administration in pathologies where steroid biosynthesis
      is a crucial factor, i.e., PCOS, has provided satisfactory results. Methods:
      Therefore, we studied the synergistic effects of the two previously known active 
      compounds. In rats with letrozole-induced PCOS, we focused on alternative
      therapies using EC and/or DCI extracts to alleviate ovarian failure. Results: As 
      a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, letrozole inhibits the conversion of
      testosterone to estrogen and subsequently causes PCOS. We divided 6-week-old
      female mice into the following six groups and evaluated them: vehicle, PCOS, PCOS
      + MET (metformin), PCOS + DCI, PCOS + EC, and PCOS + DCI + EC. In our study, PCOS
      rats treated with EC and DCI had low serum LH and T levels and low serum levels
      of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha and IL-6. These treatments also
      appeared to regulate the production of factors that affect follicle formation and
      inflammation in the ovaries. Conclusion: We concluded that EC extract and/or DCI 
      administration influenced aromatase production and reduced LH and T stimulation, 
      and cotreatment with EC and DCI consequently restored ovarian dysfunction or
      anti-inflammatory responses in rats with PCOS-like symptoms.

AB  - The Na(+),K(+)-ATPase generates electrochemical gradients of Na(+) and K(+)
      across the plasma membrane via a functional cycle that includes various
      phosphoenzyme intermediates. However, the structure and function of these
      intermediates and how metal fluorides mimick them require further investigation. 
      Here, we describe a 4.0 A resolution crystal structure and functional properties 
      of the pig kidney Na(+),K(+)-ATPase stabilized by the inhibitor beryllium
      fluoride (denoted E2-BeFx). E2-BeFx is expected to mimic properties of the E2P
      phosphoenzyme, yet with unknown characteristics of ion and ligand binding. The
      structure resembles the E2P form obtained by phosphorylation from inorganic
      phosphate (Pi) and stabilized by cardiotonic steroids, including a low-affinity
      Mg(2+) site near ion binding site II. Our anomalous Fourier analysis of the
      crystals soaked in Rb(+) (a K(+) congener) followed by a low-resolution
      rigid-body refinement (6.9-7.5 A) revealed pre-occlusion transitions leading to
      activation of the dephosphorylation reaction. We show that the Mg(2+) location
      indicates a site of initial K(+) recognition and acceptance upon binding to the
      outward-open E2P state after Na(+) release. Furthermore, using binding and
      activity studies, we find that the BeFx-inhibited enzyme is also able to bind
      ADP/ATP and Na(+). These results relate the E2-BeFx complex to a transient K(+)- 
      and ADP-sensitive E*P intermediate of the functional cycle of the
      Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, prior to E2P.

TI  - Generation of singlet oxygen over CeO2/K,Na-codoped g-C3N4 for tetracycline
      hydrochloride degradation over a wide pH range.
LID - 10.1039/d2dt01748b [doi]
AB  - Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) species have been widely studied in catalytic oxidation
      and photodynamic therapy (PDT) and so on due to their unique properties, such as 
      their long lifetime, wide pH tolerance, relative long migration distance, and
      high selectivity. In this work, (1)O2 could be generated over CeO2/K,Na-codoped
      g-C3N4 heterojunction (CeO2/CN) fabricated using a molten salt method in the
      presence of H2O2 in dark for the first time, which was used as a Fenton-like
      catalyst to degrade the emerging tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) pollutant
      through a Fenton-like reaction. A significantly-enhanced catalytic activity was
      observed over CeO2/CN compared with g-C3N4 and commercial CeO2. The Ce(4+)/Ce(3+)
      redox system was found to play a vital role in the formation of (1)O2 from the
      disproportionation of superoxide radical ( O2(-)). The (1)O2 and O2(-) radicals
      were observed as the main active species in the highly-efficient degradation of
      TCH over a wide pH range (1.20-11.20). The strong interfacial interaction of
      CeO2/CN promoted the Ce(4+)/Ce(3+) redox and the generation of active species.
      The catalytic mechanism of TCH decomposition was also proposed. This finding
      introduces an efficient and promising approach for the preparation of the
      highly-effective Fenton-like catalysts for water purification.

      Genotyping.
PG  - 941340
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.941340 [doi]
AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, also named << SNP chips >>, enable
      very large numbers of individuals to be genotyped at a targeted set of thousands 
      of genome-wide identified markers. We used preexisting variant datasets from
      USDA, a French commercial line and 30X-coverage whole genome sequencing of INRAE 
      isogenic lines to develop an Affymetrix 665 K SNP array (HD chip) for rainbow
      trout. In total, we identified 32,372,492 SNPs that were polymorphic in the USDA 
      or INRAE databases. A subset of identified SNPs were selected for inclusion on
      the chip, prioritizing SNPs whose flanking sequence uniquely aligned to the
      Swanson reference genome, with homogenous repartition over the genome and the
      highest Minimum Allele Frequency in both USDA and French databases. Of the
      664,531 SNPs which passed the Affymetrix quality filters and were manufactured on
      the HD chip, 65.3% and 60.9% passed filtering metrics and were polymorphic in two
      other distinct French commercial populations in which, respectively, 288 and 175 
      sampled fish were genotyped. Only 576,118 SNPs mapped uniquely on both Swanson
      and Arlee reference genomes, and 12,071 SNPs did not map at all on the Arlee
      reference genome. Among those 576,118 SNPs, 38,948 SNPs were kept from the
      commercially available medium-density 57 K SNP chip. We demonstrate the utility
      of the HD chip by describing the high rates of linkage disequilibrium at 2-10 kb 
      in the rainbow trout genome in comparison to the linkage disequilibrium observed 
      at 50-100 kb which are usual distances between markers of the medium-density
      chip.

TI  - Test-to-Stay Implementation in Four Pre-K-12 School Districts.
LID - 10.1542/peds.2022-057362 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Globally, COVID-19 has affected how children learn. We evaluated the
      impact of Test to Stay (TTS) on secondary and tertiary transmission of SARS-CoV-2
      and potential impact on in-person learning in four school districts in the United
      States from September 13-November 19, 2021. METHODS: Implementation of TTS varied
      across school districts. Data on index cases, school-based close contacts, TTS
      participation, and testing results were obtained from four school districts in
      diverse geographic regions. Descriptive statistics, secondary and tertiary attack
      risk, and a theoretical estimate of impact on in-person learning were calculated.
      RESULTS: Fifty-one schools in four school districts reported 374 COVID-19 index
      cases and 2,520 school-based close contacts eligible for TTS. The proportion
      participating in TTS ranged from 22%-79%. By district, the secondary attack risk 
      (SAR) and tertiary attack risk (TAR) among TTS participants ranged between
      2.2%-11.1% and 0%-17.6%, respectively. Nine clusters were identified among
      secondary cases and two among tertiary cases. The theoretical maximum number of
      days of in-person learning saved by using TTS was 976-4,650 days across
      jurisdictions. CONCLUSIONS: TTS preserves in-person learning days. Decisions to
      participate in TTS may have been influenced by ease of access to testing,
      communication between schools and families, testing logistics, and school
      resources. TAR determination became more complicated when numbers of close
      contacts increased. Minimizing exposure through continued implementation of
      layered prevention strategies is imperative. To ensure adequate resources for
      implementation of TTS, community transmission levels should be considered.

AB  - Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death marked by iron-dependent lipid
      peroxidation(1), has a key role in organ injury, degenerative disease and
      vulnerability of therapy-resistant cancers(2). Although substantial progress has 
      been made in understanding the molecular processes relevant to ferroptosis,
      additional cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic processes that determine cell
      sensitivity toward ferroptosis remain unknown. Here we show that the fully
      reduced forms of vitamin K-a group of naphthoquinones that includes menaquinone
      and phylloquinone(3)-confer a strong anti-ferroptotic function, in addition to
      the conventional function linked to blood clotting by acting as a cofactor for
      gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), a
      NAD(P)H-ubiquinone reductase and the second mainstay of ferroptosis control after
      glutathione peroxidase-4(4,5), was found to efficiently reduce vitamin K to its
      hydroquinone, a potent radical-trapping antioxidant and inhibitor of
      (phospho)lipid peroxidation. The FSP1-mediated reduction of vitamin K was also
      responsible for the antidotal effect of vitamin K against warfarin poisoning. It 
      follows that FSP1 is the enzyme mediating warfarin-resistant vitamin K reduction 
      in the canonical vitamin K cycle(6). The FSP1-dependent non-canonical vitamin K
      cycle can act to protect cells against detrimental lipid peroxidation and
      ferroptosis.

TI  - The Interaction of K and O2 on Au(111): Multiple Growth Modes of Potassium Oxide 
      and Their Catalytic Activity for CO Oxidation.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202208666 [doi]
AB  - In industrial catalysis, alkali cations are frequently used to promote activity
      or selectivity. Scanning tunneling microscopy, ambient-pressure X-ray
      photoelecron spectroscopy, and density-functional calculations were used to study
      the structure and reactivity of potassium oxides in contact with the Au(111)
      surface. Three different types of oxides (K 2 O 2 , K 2 O and KO y with y < 0.5) 
      were observed on top of the gold substrate at 300-525 K. Initially, small
      aggregates of K 2 O 2 /K 2 O (1-2nm in size) were seen at the elbows of the
      herringbone structure. After increasing the K coverage (> 0.15 ML), large islands
      of the oxide (20-40 nm in size) appeared. These islands contained a mixture of K 
      2 O and KO y (y < 0.5). A key correlation was found involving the structure,
      oxidation state, and chemical activity of the alkali oxide. The small aggregates 
      of potassium oxide had a very high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO,
      being much more than plain promoters.

LID - 10.1063/1.5135388 [doi]
AB  - Using a magnetic bottle multi-electron time-of-flight spectrometer in combination
      with synchrotron radiation, double-core-hole pre-edge and continuum states
      involving the K-shell of the carbon atoms in n-butane (n-C4H10) have been
      identified, where the ejected core electron(s) and the emitted Auger electrons
      from the decay of such states have been detected in coincidence. An assignment of
      the main observed spectral features is based on the results of
      multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations for the
      excitation energies and static exchange (STEX) calculations for energies and
      intensities. MCSCF results have been analyzed in terms of static and dynamic
      electron relaxation as well as electron correlation contributions to
      double-core-hole state ionization potentials. The analysis of applicability of
      the STEX method, which implements the one-particle picture toward the complete
      basis set limit, is motivated by the fact that it scales well toward large
      species. We find that combining the MCSCF and STEX techniques is a viable
      approach to analyze double-core-hole spectra.

AB  - Bogs are ombrotrophic, relying solely on atmospheric deposition for new inputs of
      elements. Increased element deposition through anthropogenic activities has the
      potential to alter nutrient availability, and hence ecosystem function, in bogs. 
      Further, because of efficient element retention, bogs may function as effective
      monitors of element deposition. To assess the potential effects of particulate
      fugitive dust from oil sands development in Alberta, Canada, we quantified
      plant/lichen tissue Ca, Mg, K, and P concentrations in 6 bogs ranging from 12 to 
      77km from the oil sands industrial center. Deposition of Ca and Mg, but not K or 
      P, quantified using ion exchange resin collectors, to bogs decreased with
      distance from the oil sands industrial center. Concentrations of Ca and Mg, but
      not K or P, in tissues of lichens (Cladonia mitis, Evernia mesomorpha) and
      Sphagnum (S. capillifolium, S. fuscum) decreased with distance from the oil sands
      industrial center. Tissue Ca concentrations were positively correlated with
      growing season Ca and Mg deposition in all species except Vaccinium oxycoccos,
      Rhododendron groenlandicum, and Picea mariana; leaf Mg concentrations were
      positively correlated with growing season Mg deposition for all species except P.
      mariana. Tissue concentrations of K and P were not correlated with growing season
      K and P deposition. For each species, receptor modeling identified two distinct
      sources, one dominated by Ca and Mg, presumed to represent particulate fugitive
      dust from oil sands activities, and a second dominated by K and P, which may
      reflect tight internal cycling and upward translocation of K and P in peat and/or
      K and P deposition as particulates generated in wildfires. Increasing Ca(2+) and 
      Mg(2+) deposition may acidify bog porewaters through cation exchange in peat.

TI  - Evaluation of the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT for detection of carbapenemases in
      Gram-negative bacilli.
PG  - 190-192
AB  - Enterobacterales as opportunistic pathogens are commonly associated with
      nosocomial infections. With increasing frequency, Gram-negative bacilli,
      especially Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, are mul- tidrug-resistant or
      pandrug-resistant. Carbapenems were used as the drugs of choice for the treat-
      ment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. The aim
      of this study was to assess the usefulness of the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT for the
      rapid detection and identification of the most important carbapenemases (OXA-48, 
      KPC, NDM, VIM) in Enterobacterales bacilli. The study involved the isolates of 97
      Enterobacterales strains. The ability to produce carbapenemases was determined by
      the immunochromatographic RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test. This test detected
      carbapenemases OXA-48, KPC, NDM, and VIM. For the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test, a
      positive result was obtained for 93 strains (95.9%). Four strains negative in the
      RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT were positive in the Eazyplex(R)SuperBugCRE and PCR.
      These strains produce VIM enzymes. RE- SIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test is rapid,
      simple to perform and can be used for fast detection of the most important
      carbapenemases (OXA-48, KPC, NDM, VIM) among Gram-negative bacilli.

TI  - Determinants of label non-adherence to non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in
      patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.
PG  - oeac022
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac022 [doi]
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the extent and determinants of off-label non-vitamin K oral
      anticoagulant (NOAC) dosing in newly diagnosed Dutch AF patients. Methods and
      results: In the DUTCH-AF registry, patients with newly diagnosed AF (<6 months)
      are prospectively enrolled. Label adherence to NOAC dosing was assessed using the
      European Medicines Agency labelling. Factors associated with off-label dosing
      were explored by multivariable logistic regression analyses. From July 2018 to
      November 2020, 4500 patients were registered. The mean age was 69.6 +/- 10.5
      years, and 41.5% were female. Of the 3252 patients in which NOAC label adherence 
      could be assessed, underdosing and overdosing were observed in 4.2% and 2.4%,
      respectively. In 2916 (89.7%) patients with a full-dose NOAC recommendation, 4.6%
      were underdosed, with a similar distribution between NOACs. Independent
      determinants (with 95% confidence interval) were higher age [odds ratio (OR):
      1.01 per year, 1.01-1.02], lower renal function (OR: 0.96 per ml/min/1.73 m(2),
      0.92-0.98), lower weight (OR: 0.98 per kg, 0.97-1.00), active malignancy (OR:
      2.46, 1.19-5.09), anaemia (OR: 1.73, 1.08-2.76), and concomitant use of
      antiplatelets (OR: 4.93, 2.57-9.46). In the 336 (10.3%) patients with a reduced
      dose NOAC recommendation, 22.9% were overdosed, most often with rivaroxaban.
      Independent determinants were lower age (OR: 0.92 per year, 0.88-0.96) and lower 
      renal function (OR: 0.98 per ml/min/1.73 m(2), 0.96-1.00). Conclusion: In newly
      diagnosed Dutch AF patients, off-label dosing of NOACs was seen in only 6.6% of
      patients, most often underdosing. In this study, determinants of off-label dosing
      were age, renal function, weight, anaemia, active malignancy, and concomitant use
      of antiplatelets.

TI  - Vitamin K antagonist use induces calcification and atherosclerotic plaque
      progression resulting in increased hypercoagulability.
PG  - oeab017
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab017 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Vascular calcification is a hallmark of atherosclerotic burden and can
      predict the cardiovascular outcome. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are widely used
      anticoagulant drugs to treat patients at risk of arterial and venous thrombosis
      but are also associated with increase vascular calcification progression. We aim 
      to unravel the paradox that VKA suppresses plasma coagulation but promotes
      vascular calcification and subsequent atherosclerosis-dependent coagulability of 
      the vessel wall. Methods and results: Apoe (-/-) mice were placed on western-type
      diet enriched with the VKA warfarin for 18 weeks to measure atherosclerotic
      plaque burden, calcification, and coagulation. Patients (n = 54) displaying
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a low cardiovascular risk, who were treated
      with VKA were included to measure pre-thrombotic state. Finally, primary vascular
      smooth muscle cells (VSMC) derived from human tissue explants were used for in
      vitro experiments. In Apoe (-/-) mice, VKA increases both atherosclerotic plaque 
      size and calcification. Higher plaque calcification was associated with increased
      plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin and factor IXa-antithrombin complexes in
      mice and patients treated with VKA. Mechanistically, phenotypic switching of VSMC
      into synthetic VSMC promotes thrombin generation, which is enhanced in a
      tissue-factor (TF)-dependent manner by VSMC calcification. Moreover, calcified
      VSMC exposed to whole blood under flow significantly enhanced platelet deposition
      and TF-dependent fibrin formation. Conclusions: Oral anticoagulation with VKA
      aggravates vascular calcification and atherosclerosis. VSMC phenotype
      differentiation impacts coagulation potential in a TF-dependent manner.
      VKA-induced vascular calcification increases hypercoagulability and could thereby
      potentially positively affect atherothrombosis.

AB  - The study of the effects of Na and K on the heterogeneous adsorption of
      hydroxyl-containing char with NO is important for the clean utilization of high
      alkali coal. In this paper, the effects of Na/K atoms on the adsorption of NO on 
      the char surface were investigated at the GGA-PBE level by choosing zigzag type, 
      armchair type, and saturated hydroxyl-containing char structures based on DFT. It
      was found that the adsorption stability of NO on structures with active sites was
      greater for sites close to the hydroxyl group than that for sites far from the
      hydroxyl group. The stability of char doped by Na/K is related to the char
      structure and the position of functional groups. The most stable Na/K doped
      structures are Z-OH-2 (Eads= -350.50 kJ/mol) and A-OH-1-2 (Eads= -339.17 kJ/mol),
      respectively. The participation of Na/K can increase the adsorption energy of the
      three structures with NO, and especially the adsorption energy of saturated char 
      with NO is increased by as much as 5 times. The reason for that is the promotion 
      of the hybridization of the C and NO p orbitals. The comprehensive analysis of
      electrostatic potential, charge transfer, and front orbitals indicates that the
      effects of decorated sodium and potassium atoms on the char surface are very
      similar. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the study of the
      heterogeneous reduction process.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of X-ray damage on conformational heterogeneity in
      room-temperature (277 K) and cryo-cooled protein crystals.
PG  - 945-963
LID - 10.1107/S2059798322005939 [doi]
AB  - Cryo-cooling has been nearly universally adopted to mitigate X-ray damage and
      facilitate crystal handling in protein X-ray crystallography. However, cryo X-ray
      crystallographic data provide an incomplete window into the ensemble of
      conformations that is at the heart of protein function and energetics.
      Room-temperature (RT) X-ray crystallography provides accurate ensemble
      information, and recent developments allow conformational heterogeneity (the
      experimental manifestation of ensembles) to be extracted from single-crystal
      data. Nevertheless, high sensitivity to X-ray damage at RT raises concerns about 
      data reliability. To systematically address this critical issue, increasingly
      X-ray-damaged high-resolution data sets (1.02-1.52 A resolution) were obtained
      from single proteinase K, thaumatin and lysozyme crystals at RT (277 K). In each 
      case a modest increase in conformational heterogeneity with X-ray damage was
      observed. Merging data with different extents of damage (as is typically carried 
      out) had negligible effects on conformational heterogeneity until the overall
      diffraction intensity decayed to approximately 70% of its initial value. These
      effects were compared with X-ray damage effects in cryo-cooled crystals by
      carrying out an analogous analysis of increasingly damaged proteinase K cryo data
      sets (0.9-1.16 A resolution). X-ray damage-associated heterogeneity changes were 
      found that were not observed at RT. This property renders it difficult to
      distinguish real from artefactual conformations and to determine the
      conformational response to changes in temperature. The ability to acquire
      reliable heterogeneity information from single crystals at RT, together with
      recent advances in RT data collection at accessible synchrotron beamlines,
      provides a strong motivation for the widespread adoption of RT X-ray
      crystallography to obtain conformational ensemble information.

TI  - Genome-wide association mapping of Hagberg falling number, protein content, test 
      weight, and grain yield in U.K. wheat.
PG  - 965-981
LID - 10.1002/csc2.20692 [doi]
AB  - Association mapping using crop cultivars allows identification of genetic loci of
      direct relevance to breeding. Here, 150 U.K. wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
      cultivars genotyped with 23,288 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used 
      for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using historical phenotypic data for
      grain protein content, Hagberg falling number (HFN), test weight, and grain
      yield. Power calculations indicated experimental design would enable detection of
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining >/=20% of the variation (PVE) at a
      relatively high power of >80%, falling to 40% for detection of a SNP with an R(2)
      >/= .5 with the same QTL. Genome-wide association studies identified marker-trait
      associations for all four traits. For HFN (h (2 )= .89), six QTL were identified,
      including a major locus on chromosome 7B explaining 49% PVE and reducing HFN by
      44 s. For protein content (h (2 )= 0.86), 10 QTL were found on chromosomes 1A,
      2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 6B, together explaining 48.9% PVE. For test weight, five QTL 
      were identified (one on 1B and four on 3B; 26.3% PVE). Finally, 14 loci were
      identified for grain yield (h (2 )= 0.95) on eight chromosomes (1A, 2A, 2B, 2D,
      3A, 5B, 6A, 6B; 68.1% PVE), of which five were located within 16 Mbp of genetic
      regions previously identified as under breeder selection in European wheat. Our
      study demonstrates the utility of exploiting historical crop datasets,
      identifying genomic targets for independent validation, and ultimately for wheat 
      genetic improvement.

AB  - Rare earth Tb(3+) doped (K0.465Na0.465Li0.07)(Nb0.93Bi0.07)O3 (KNNLB-x%Tb)
      lead-free transparent ferroelectric ceramics were designed and prepared. The
      effects of Tb(3+) on phase structure, microstructure, optical transmittance,
      photoluminescence, and photochromic behaviors were studied. Although two
      ferroelectric phases coexist, the optical transmittance can reach the high value 
      of 74% in the visible light region because of the fine grains, dense ceramic
      microstructure, large optical energy band gap, and relatively high symmetry of
      coexisting ferroelectric phases. In addition, Tb(3+) works as a luminescent
      center, and the reversible photochromic modulation is achieved by alternate
      stimulation of illumination and heat treatment. Meanwhile, the luminescence
      contrast can be improved under in situ electric field stimulation due to the easy
      change of lattice symmetry in coexisting ferroelectric phases. The generation of 
      color centers after illumination and the local crystal field around the
      luminescent center caused by in situ electric field contributes to above
      phenomena. These ceramics exhibit the great potential in optical data storage and
      anticounterfeiting.

TI  - Lysosomal K(+) channel TMEM175 promotes apoptosis and aggravates symptoms of
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - e53234
LID - 10.15252/embr.202153234 [doi]
AB  - Lysosomes are degradative organelles and play vital roles in a variety of
      cellular processes. Ion channels on the lysosomal membrane are key regulators of 
      lysosomal function. TMEM175 has been identified as a lysosomal potassium channel,
      but its modulation and physiological functions remain unclear. Here, we show that
      the apoptotic regulator Bcl-2 binds to and inhibits TMEM175 activity.
      Accordingly, Bcl-2 inhibitors activate the channel in a caspase-independent way. 
      Increased TMEM175 function inhibits mitophagy, disrupts mitochondrial
      homeostasis, and increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS
      further activates TMEM175 and thus forms a positive feedback loop to augment
      apoptosis. In a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model
      of Parkinson's disease (PD), knockout (KO) of TMEM175 mitigated motor impairment 
      and dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss, suggesting that TMEM175-mediated apoptosis
      plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Overall, our study reveals
      that TMEM175 is an important regulatory site in the apoptotic signaling pathway
      and a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease (PD).

AB  - The design, synthesis, and applications of new boranes are eternal topics in
      boron chemistry. A new bis(borane)alkanethiolate salt, K[BH3S(CH3)BH3], was
      synthesized in high yield by the reaction of K with (CH3)2S.BH3 at room
      temperature. The formation mechanism was elucidated based on experimental and
      theoretical studies. The single-crystal structure of the
      K[BH3S(CH3)BH3].18-crown-6 adduct was determined in which the B-S-B bonding
      information of K[BH3S(CH3)BH3] was illustrated for the first time. Using
      K[BH3S(CH3)BH3] as a starting material, KB3H8 was successfully synthesized.

AB  - Cathepsin K (Ctsk) is a cysteine protease of the papain superfamily initially
      identified in differentiated osteoclasts; it plays a critical role in degrading
      the bone matrix. However, subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies based on animal
      models elucidate novel subpopulations of Ctsk-expressing cells, which display
      markers and properties of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells. This review
      introduces the function, identity, and role of Ctsk(+) cells and their
      therapeutic implications in related preclinical osseous disorder models. It also 
      summarizes the available in vivo models for studying Ctsk(+) cells and their
      progeny. Further investigations of detailed properties and mechanisms of Ctsk(+) 
      cells in transgenic models are required to guide potential therapeutic targets in
      multiple diseases in the future.

TI  - A Multi-Scale Approach to Model K(+) Permeation Through the KcsA Channel.
PG  - 880660
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.880660 [doi]
AB  - K(+) channels allow a very efficient passage of K(+) ions through the membrane
      while excluding Na(+) ions, and these properties are essential for life. The 3D
      structure of the KcsA K(+) channel, solved more than 20 years ago, allows to
      address many relevant aspects of K(+) permeation and selectivity mechanisms at
      the molecular level. Recent crystallographic data and molecular dynamics (MD)
      studies suggest that no water is normally present inside the selectivity filter
      (SF), which can instead accommodate four adjacent K(+) ions. Using a multi-scale 
      approach, whereby information taken from a low-level simulation approach is used 
      to feed a high-level model, we studied the mechanism of K(+) permeation through
      KcsA channels. More specifically, we used MD to find stable ion configurations
      under physiological conditions. They were characterized by two adjacent K(+) ions
      occupying the more central positions of the SF (sites S2 and S3), while the other
      two K(+) ions could be found at the external and internal entrances to the SF.
      Sites S1 and S4 were instead not occupied by K(+). A continuum
      Bikerman-Poisson-Boltzmann model that takes into account the volume of the ions
      and their dehydration when entering the SF fully confirmed the MD results,
      showing peaks of K(+) occupancy at S2, S3, and the external and internal
      entrances, with S1 and S4 sites being virtually never occupied by K(+). Inspired 
      by the newly found ion configuration in the SF at equilibrium, we developed a
      simple kinetic permeation model which, fed with kinetic rate constants assessed
      from molecular meta-dynamics, reproduced the main permeation properties of the
      KcsA channel found experimentally, including sublinear current-voltage and
      saturating conductance-concentration relationships. This good agreement with the 
      experimental data also implies that the ion configuration in the SF we identified
      at equilibrium would also be a key configuration during permeation.

TI  - Gastric Th17 Cells Specific for H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Serum IL-17 Signature in
      Gastric Autoimmunity.
PG  - 952674
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.952674 [doi]
AB  - Human gastric autoimmunity [autoimmune gastritis (AIG)] is characterized by
      inflammation of the gastric mucosa and parietal cell loss. The gastric parietal
      cell proton pump H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)/K(+)-ATPase) is the
      major autoantigen in AIG. Our work aimed to investigate the gastric
      H(+)/K(+)-ATPase-specific T helper 17 (Th17) responses in AIG and serum
      interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine subfamily in AIG patients, in healthy subjects
      [healthy controls (HCs)], and in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA)
      without AIG. We analyzed the activation of gastric lamina propria mononuclear
      cells (LPMCs) by H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and the IL-17A and IL-17F cytokine production
      in eight patients with AIG and four HCs. Furthermore, we compared serum levels of
      IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-17E, IL-22, and IL-23 in 43 AIG patients, in 47 HCs,
      and in 20 IDA patients without AIG. Gastric LPMCs from all AIG patients, but not 
      those from HCs, were activated by H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and were able to proliferate
      and produce high levels of IL-17A and IL-17F. AIG patients have significantly
      higher serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E (393.3 +/- 410.02 pg/ml, 394.0 +/-
      378.03 pg/ml, 300.46 +/- 303.45 pg/ml, 34.92 +/- 32.56 pg/ml, respectively) than 
      those in HCs (222.99 +/- 361.24 pg/ml, 217.49 +/- 312.1 pg/ml, 147.43 +/- 259.17 
      pg/ml, 8.69 +/- 8.98 pg/ml, respectively) and those in IDA patients without AIG
      (58.06 +/- 107.49 pg/ml, 74.26 +/- 178.50 pg/ml, 96.86 +/- 177.46 pg/ml, 10.64
      +/- 17.70 pg/ml, respectively). Altogether, our results indicate that IL-17A and 
      IL-17F are produced in vivo in the stomach of AIG patients following activation
      with H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and that serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E levels are
      significantly elevated in AIG patients but not in patients without AIG. These
      data suggest a Th17 signature in AIG and that IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E
      may represent a relevant tool for AIG management.

AB  - Rapid growth of single-cell sequencing techniques enables researchers to
      investigate almost millions of cells with diverse properties in a single
      experiment. Meanwhile, it also presents great challenges for selecting
      representative samples from massive single-cell populations for further
      experimental characterization, which requires a robust and compact sampling with 
      balancing diverse properties of different priority levels. The conventional
      sampling methods fail to generate representative and generalizable subsets from a
      massive single-cell population or more complicated ensembles. Here, we present a 
      toolkit called Cookie which can efficiently select out the most representative
      samples from a massive single-cell population with diverse properties. This
      method quantifies the relationships/similarities among samples using their
      Manhattan distances by vectorizing all given properties and then determines an
      appropriate sample size by evaluating the coverage of key properties from
      multiple candidate sizes, following by a k-medoids clustering to group samples
      into several clusters and selects centers from each cluster as the most
      representatives. Comparison of Cookie with conventional sampling methods using a 
      single-cell atlas dataset, epidemiology surveillance data, and a simulated
      dataset shows the high efficacy, efficiency, and flexibly of Cookie. The Cookie
      toolkit is implemented in R and is freely available at
      https://wilsonimmunologylab.github.io/Cookie/.

AB  - The prediction of protein function is a common topic in the field of
      bioinformatics. In recent years, advances in machine learning have inspired a
      growing number of algorithms for predicting protein function. A large number of
      parameters and fairly complex neural networks are often used to improve the
      prediction performance, an approach that is time-consuming and costly. In this
      study, we leveraged traditional features and machine learning classifiers to
      boost the performance of vesicle transport protein identification and make the
      prediction process faster. We adopt the pseudo position-specific scoring matrix
      (PsePSSM) feature and our proposed new classifier hypergraph regularized k-local 
      hyperplane distance nearest neighbour (HG-HKNN) to classify vesicular transport
      proteins. We address dataset imbalances with random undersampling. The results
      show that our strategy has an area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUC) of 0.870 and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.53 on the 
      benchmark dataset, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods on the same
      dataset, and other metrics of our model are also comparable to existing methods.

TI  - Explanation and Exploration of the Isothermal Titration Curve for the NaCl +
      Na2SO4 + H2O System at 298.15 K and 102.2 kPa.
PG  - 25811-25821
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c03339 [doi]
AB  - Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) is a common and powerful tool in
      thermodynamics and related fields, and the connection between the solution
      behavior and raw titration curve is complex, important, and worth studying, so we
      try to discuss this problem using a complex solid-solid-liquid diagram. Although 
      there are many experimental methods for studying ternary phase diagrams, ITC has 
      been proven to be a simple, universal method at normal temperature and pressure. 
      This method can be extended to investigate phase diagrams of multisalt aqueous
      solutions and related systems. Here, the phase equilibrium of one common ternary 
      system (NaCl + Na2SO4 + H2O) was determined using the ITC method with the aid of 
      X-ray diffraction measurements. This isothermal and isobaric titration method can
      be used not only to determine the boundaries of different phase regions by
      analyzing changes in the slope of the observed heat vs solvent concentration plot
      but also to provide additional accurate data regarding the solid dissolution
      enthalpy and the dilution enthalpy. The dissolution enthalpy of 1 mol NaCl
      (Na2SO4) solid dissolving in water to just form a saturated solution is measured 
      at 1.92 kJ/mol (-15.60 kJ/mol), and the dissolution enthalpy of the mixed solids 
      can be evaluated with these data. The dilution enthalpy is strongly dependent on 
      the solute concentration (0.08-0.23 kJ/mol at the range of concentration
      studied), and for the same range concentration of a solute, the dilution enthalpy
      of Na2SO4 is positive and larger than that of NaCl. Therefore, the connection
      between the observed heat and the microscopic behavior and the separation between
      the dissolution and dilution data may result in the possibility to gain a clearer
      understanding about the solution behaviors.

TI  - Polymyxin Resistance in Clinical Isolates of K. pneumoniae in Brazil: Update on
      Molecular Mechanisms, Clonal Dissemination and Relationship With KPC-Producing
      Strains.
PG  - 898125
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.898125 [doi]
AB  - In Brazil, the production of KPC-type carbapenemases in Enterobacteriales is
      endemic, leading to widespread use of polymyxins. In the present study, 502
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated for resistance to polymyxins, their
      genetic determinants and clonality, in addition to the presence of carbapenem
      resistance genes and evaluation of antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to
      colistin (polymyxin E) was evaluated through initial selection on EMB agar
      containing 4% colistin sulfate, followed by Minimal Inhibitory Concentration
      (MIC) determination by broth microdilution. The susceptibility to 17
      antimicrobials was assessed by disk diffusion. The presence of bla KPC, bla NDM
      and bla OXA-48-like carbapenemases was investigated by phenotypic methods and
      conventional PCR. Molecular typing was performed by PFGE and MLST. Allelic
      variants of the mcr gene were screened by PCR and chromosomal mutations in the
      pmrA, pmrB, phoP, phoQ and mgrB genes were investigated by sequencing. Our work
      showed a colistin resistance frequency of 29.5% (n = 148/502) in K. pneumoniae
      isolates. Colistin MICs from 4 to >128 microg/mL were identified (MIC50 = 64
      microg/mL; MIC90 >128 microg/mL). All isolates were considered MDR, with the
      lowest resistance rates observed for amikacin (34.4%), and 19.6% of the isolates 
      were resistant to all tested antimicrobials. The bla KPC gene was identified in
      77% of the isolates, in consonance with the high rate of resistance to polymyxins
      related to its use as a therapeutic alternative. Through XbaI-PFGE, 51 pulsotypes
      were identified. MLST showed 21 STs, with ST437, ST258 and ST11 (CC11) being the 
      most prevalent, and two new STs were determined: ST4868 and ST4869. The mcr-1
      gene was identified in 3 K. pneumoniae isolates. Missense mutations in
      chromosomal genes were identified, as well as insertion sequences in mgrB.
      Furthermore, the identification of chromosomal mutations in K. pneumoniae
      isolates belonging from CC11 ensures its success as a high-risk epidemic clone in
      Brazil and worldwide.

TI  - Neglected vitamin K deficiency causing coagulation dysfunction in an older
      patient with pneumonia: a case report.
PG  - 628
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03327-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of coagulation disorders can be dangerous and fatal
      in the older people, especially those with multiple medical conditions. Vitamin
      K-dependent coagulation disorders are easily overlooked when anticoagulant drugs 
      are not used and the patient shows no signs of bleeding. CASE PRESENTATION: We
      report a case of a 71-year-old male suffering from pulmonary infection with
      severe coagulation disorder without bleeding symptoms. He also had a history of
      Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cardiac insufficiency. Coagulation
      tests were normal at the time of admission, prothrombin time (PT) is 13.9
      (normal, 9.5-13.1) seconds and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)
      is 30.2 (normal, 25.1-36.5) seconds. But it turned severely abnormal after 20
      days (PT: 136.1 s, APTT: 54.8 s). However, no anticoagulants such as warfarin was
      used and no bleeding symptoms were observed. Subsequent mixing studies with
      normal plasma showed a decrease in prothrombin times. Vitamin K deficiency was
      thought to be the cause of coagulation disorders considering long-term antibiotic
      therapy, especially cephalosporins, inadequate diet and abnormal liver function. 
      After supplementation with 20 mg of vitamin K, coagulation dysfunction was
      rescued the next day and serious consequences were effectively prevented.
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, timely vitamin K supplementation with antimicrobials that
      affect vitamin K metabolism requires clinician attention, especially in older
      patients who are multimorbid, frail or nutritionally compromised, and are
      admitted to hospital because of an infection that needs antimicrobial therapy are
      at risk of clotting disorders due to abnormal vitamin K metabolism secondary to
      altered gut flora, which can exacerbate existing nutritional deficiencies.

AB  - Vitamin K is vital for normal blood coagulation, and may influence bone,
      neurological and vascular health. Data on the vitamin K content of Australian
      foods are limited, preventing estimation of vitamin K intakes in the Australian
      population. We measured phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinone (MK) -4 to -10 in
      cheese, yoghurt and meat products (48 composite samples from 288 primary samples)
      by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry.
      At least one K vitamer was found in every sample. The greatest mean (+/- standard
      deviation for foods sampled in multiple cities) concentrations of PK (4.9
      microg/100 g), MK-4 (58 +/- 9 microg/100 g) and MK-9 (8 +/- 2 microg/100 g) were 
      found in lamb liver, chicken leg meat and Cheddar cheese, respectively. Cheddar
      cheese (1.1 +/- 0.3 microg/100 g) and cream cheese (1.0 microg/100 g) contained
      MK-5. MK-8 was found in Cheddar cheese only (4 +/- 2 microg/100 g). As the K
      vitamer profile and concentrations appear to vary considerably by geographical
      location, Australia needs a vitamin K food composition dataset that is
      representative of foods consumed in Australia.

TI  - Concentration and mobility of trace elements (Li, Ba, Sr, Ag, Hg, B) and
      macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K) in soil-orchid system on different bedrock types.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22110-z [doi]
AB  - The mobility of chemical elements in the soil-orchid system has been poorly
      studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the uptake and mobility of several 
      trace (Li, Ba, Sr, Ag, Hg, and B) and macronutrients (Ca, Mg, and K) in the
      orchid Anacamptis morio (L.) R.M.Bateman, Pridgeon & M.W.Chase from soils in
      western Serbia. The sampling sites are characterized by three different bedrock
      types-cherts, limestones, and serpentines, which are the source of the
      significant chemical differences in the elemental status of the soil and plant
      tissues. The four-step Community Bureau of Reference sequential extraction
      procedure was used to determine the distribution of fractions and predict their
      potential phytoavailability. The orchid and soil samples were analyzed for total 
      elemental content analysis using ICP-OES. The greatest potential for plant
      availability was determined for Ba and Sr, representing about 80% of the total
      soil content. More than 40% of Li in the soils was found to be potentially
      phytoavailable. Significant correlations were found between the total content of 
      Li, B, and Sr in soils. Between 38 and 60% of Li content and more than 80% of Ba 
      and Sr content were determined to be potentially phytoavailable by sequential
      analysis. The highest bioconcentration factor (> 1) was determined in the case of
      B and Sr for all orchid organs, while translocation factor for Li was highest in 
      tubers and leaves. The studied elements were mainly stored in tubers and roots,
      indicating the exclusion strategy of A. morio as a metal tolerance mechanism. The
      data obtained showed significant differences in metal content in soils and plants
      originating from sites with different parent materials, suggesting that bedrock
      type and associated soil properties are important factors that determine chemical
      element mobility and uptake.

PG  - 13006
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17292-y [doi]
AB  - We report K-Pg-age deposits in Baja California, Mexico, consisting of terrestrial
      and shallow-marine materials re-sedimented onto the continental slope, including 
      corals, gastropods, bivalves, shocked quartz grains, an andesitic tuff with a
      SHRIMP U-Pb age (66.12 +/- 0.65 Ma) indistinguishable from that of the K-Pg
      boundary, and charred tree trunks. The overlying mudstones show an iridium
      anomaly and fungal and fern spores spikes. We interpret these heterogeneous
      deposits as a direct result of the Chicxulub impact and a mega-tsunami in
      response to seismically-induced landsliding. The tsunami backwash carried the
      megaflora offshore in high-density flows, remobilizing shallow-marine fauna and
      sediment en route. Charring of the trees at temperatures up to > 1000 degrees C
      took place in the interval between impact and arrival of the tsunami, which on
      the basis of seismic velocities and historic analogues amounted to only tens of
      minutes at most. This constrains the timing and causes of fires and the minimum
      distance from the impact site over which fires may be ignited.

AB  - We have demonstrated the resonant control of the elastic scattering cross
      sections in the vicinity of Feshbach resonances between ^{23}Na^{40}K molecules
      and ^{40}K atoms by studying the thermalization between them. The elastic
      scattering cross sections vary by more than 2 orders of magnitude close to the
      resonance, and can be well described by an asymmetric Fano profile. The
      parameters that characterize the magnetically tunable s-wave scattering length
      are determined from the elastic scattering cross sections. The observation of
      resonantly controlled elastic scattering cross sections opens up the possibility 
      to study strongly interacting atom-molecule mixtures and improve our
      understanding of the complex atom-molecule Feshbach resonances.

TI  - Pressure-induced monotonic enhancement of Tc to over 30 K in superconducting
      Pr0.82Sr0.18NiO2 thin films.
PG  - 4367
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32065-x [doi]
AB  - The successful synthesis of superconducting infinite-layer nickelate thin films
      with the highest Tc approximately 15 K has ignited great enthusiasm for this
      material class as potential analogs of the high-Tc cuprates. Pursuing a higher Tc
      is always an imperative task in studying a new superconducting material system.
      Here we report high-quality Pr0.82Sr0.18NiO2 thin films with Tc(onset)
      approximately 17 K synthesized by carefully tuning the amount of CaH2 in the
      topotactic chemical reduction and the effect of pressure on its superconducting
      properties by measuring electrical resistivity under various pressures in a cubic
      anvil cell apparatus. We find that the onset temperature of the
      superconductivity, Tc(onset), can be enhanced monotonically from ~17 K at ambient
      pressure to ~31 K at 12.1 GPa without showing signatures of saturation upon
      increasing pressure. This encouraging result indicates that the Tc of
      infinite-layer nickelates superconductors still has room to go higher and it can 
      be further boosted by applying higher pressures or strain engineering in the
      heterostructure films.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement
      (TAVR) also require oral anticoagulation (OAC) for atrial fibrillation (AF) or
      deep vein thromboembolism. However, the optimal type of OAC strategy (direct oral
      anticoagulants, DOACs, or vitamin K antagonists, VKA) is still unclear in this
      setting. METHOD: We performed systematic literature research and meta-analysis in
      PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE databases for studies reporting either all-cause
      mortality, major/life-threatening bleeding or stroke events. RESULTS: Ten
      observational studies and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a
      total of 29,485 patients were eligible for inclusion. Compared to VKA, DOACs use 
      after TAVR was associated with a modest but significantly lower rates of
      all-cause mortality (RR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-0.99, p-value 0.04) with results
      mainly driven by observational studies. Cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03; 95%
      CI: 0.81-1.30; p-value 0.84), total stroke events (RR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.76-1.23,
      p-value 0.79), major/life-threatening bleeding (RR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.72-1.21,
      p-value 0.61) and minor bleeding (RR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.74-1.23; p-value 0.72) were 
      similar between VKA and DOACs. CONCLUSION: Considering the totality of available 
      evidence, in patients underwent TAVR with a concomitant indication for OAC,
      DOACs-based strategy is an effective and safe anticoagulation strategy compared
      to VKA.

TI  - Gene module regulation in dilated cardiomyopathy and the role of Na/K-ATPase.
PG  - e0272117
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272117 [doi]
AB  - Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of cardiac death and heart
      transplantation. It has been known that black people have a higher incidence of
      heart failure and related diseases compared to white people. To identify the
      relationship between gene expression and cardiac function in DCM patients, we
      performed pathway analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis
      (WGCNA) using RNA-sequencing data (GSE141910) from the NCBI Gene Expression
      Omnibus (GEO) database and identified several gene modules that were
      significantly associated with the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and DCM
      phenotype. Genes included in these modules are enriched in three major categories
      of signaling pathways: fibrosis-related, small molecule transporting-related, and
      immune response-related. Through consensus analysis, we found that gene modules
      associated with LVEF in African Americans are almost identical as in Caucasians, 
      suggesting that the two groups may have more common rather than disparate genetic
      regulations in the etiology of DCM. In addition to the identified modules, we
      found that the gene expression level of Na/K-ATPase, an important membrane ion
      transporter, has a strong correlation with the LVEF. These clinical results are
      consistent with our previous findings and suggest the clinical significance of
      Na/K-ATPase regulation in DCM.

TI  - 105 K Wide Room Temperature Spin Transition Memory Due to a Supramolecular Latch 
      Mechanism.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c05417 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the mechanisms behind the bistability (memory) of molecular
      spin transition compounds over broad temperature ranges (>100 K). To address this
      point, we report on a new discrete Fe(II) neutral complex [Fe(II)L2](0) (1) based
      on a novel asymmetric tridentate ligand
      2-(5-(3-methoxy-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl))pyridine (L). Due to
      the asymmetric cone-shaped form, in the lattice, the formed complex molecules
      stack into a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain. In the case of the
      rectangular supramolecular arrangement of chains in methanolates 1-A and 1-B
      (both orthorhombic, Pbcn) differing, respectively, by bent and extended spatial
      conformations of the 3-methoxy groups (3MeO), a moderate cooperativity is
      observed. In contrast, the hexagonal-like arrangement of supramolecular chains in
      polymorph 1-C (monoclinic, P21/c) results in steric coupling of the transforming 
      complex species with the peripheral flipping 3MeO group. The group acts as a
      supramolecular latch, locking the huge geometric distortion of complex 1 and in
      turn the trigonal distortion of the central Fe(II) ion in the high-spin state,
      thereby keeping it from the transition to the low-spin state over a large thermal
      range. Analysis of the crystal packing of 1-C reveals significantly changing
      patterns of close intermolecular interactions on going between the phases
      substantiated by the energy framework analysis. The detected supramolecular
      mechanism leads to a record-setting robust 105 K wide hysteresis spanning the
      room temperature region and an atypically large TLIESST relaxation value of 104 K
      of the photoexcited high-spin state. This work highlights a viable pathway toward
      a new generation of cleverly designed molecular memory materials.

TI  - Sexual health discussion practices and HIV clinical care provided by primary care
      providers in the Southeast United States, K-BAP Study (2017-2018).
LID - cmac081 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmac081 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research underscores the importance of providers having routine
      discussions with patients about their sexual health. We examined the occurrences 
      and association of routine sexual health discussion practices and human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical care among primary care providers (PCPs) in
      areas with high HIV prevalence. METHODS: We analysed data collected between April
      and August 2017 from an online survey that assessed PCPs knowledge, behaviours,
      attitudes, and practices of HIV-related care in 6 Southeast US jurisdictions
      (Atlanta, Baltimore, Baton Rouge, District of Columbia, Miami, and New Orleans). 
      RESULTS: Among PCPs, we found that 39.2% routinely obtained sexual health
      histories, 78.5% offered HIV testing, and 16.0% ever prescribed preexposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP). Based on adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs), the proportion of PCPs who routinely obtained sexual histories
      was higher among female PCPs (aPR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.04, 2.08), PCPs who had a
      patient population that was >50% men who have sex with men (MSM) (aPR = 1.94, 95%
      CI 1.72, 2.18), offered HIV testing (aPR = 3.60, 95% CI 2.23, 5.79), and ever
      prescribed PrEP (aPR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.06, 1.93). CONCLUSION: Improving
      patient-provider discussions are needed to reduce HIV-related service barriers
      for disproportionately affected populations. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Routine
      discussions can reduce barriers to important HIV prevention and care services and
      help reduce disparities among patients living in highly prevalent HIV locations.

TI  - Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Mechanical Valve Prostheses Using Vitamin K
      Antagonist Therapy: The Experience of the Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery in
      Sudan.

AB  - Pregnancy and childbirth on anticoagulants after mechanical heart valve
      replacement present a high risk of complications for both mother and baby. On top
      of pregnancy worsening the mother's cardiac function, anticoagulant therapy
      itself is a crucial problem. A safe and effective anticoagulation regimen for
      both mother and fetus is not possible. The most effective drugs for preventing
      valve thrombosis are VKAs, whose dosage needs to be adjusted with frequent INR
      checks. Moreover, VKAs can have embryopathic and teratogenic action. Patients in 
      follow-up and anticoagulant treatment at the Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery in 
      Sudan live spread out over a large area where transport to the Center is
      generally difficult; pregnancy treatment has, therefore, been adapted to the
      limitations of reality. Pregnancy is discouraged and contraception and
      therapeutic abortion are recommended, but this guidance frequently goes unheeded.
      Here we describe maternal and fetal outcomes in 307 consecutive pregnancies
      recorded by staff at the oral anticoagulant clinic (OAC) from April 2017 to
      November 2021. Out of 307 pregnancies, there were 15 maternal deaths (4.9%), 24
      thrombotic events (7.8%) and 22 major bleedings (7.2%). Fifty pregnancies (16.3%)
      were terminated by therapeutic abortion. Only 47.6% of pregnancies had good
      maternal and neonatal outcomes. Data clearly show that, due to the complexity of 
      pregnancy in women with mechanical heart valves and the scarcity of tertiary
      healthcare services in the area where patients live, maternal mortality is at an 
      unacceptable level and requires a structured, multi-disciplinary intervention.

TI  - Use of Solvent Mapping for Characterizing the Binding Site and for Predicting the
      Inhibition of the Human Ether-a-Go-Go-Related K(+) Channel.

AB  - Molecular dynamics was used to optimize the droperidol-hERG complex obtained from
      docking. To accommodate the inhibitor, residues T623, S624, V625, G648, Y652, and
      F656 did not move significantly during the simulation, while F627 moved
      significantly. Binding sites in cryo-EM structures and in structures obtained
      from molecular dynamics simulations were characterized using solvent mapping and 
      Atlas ligands, which were negative images of the binding site, were generated.
      Atlas ligands were found to be useful for identifying human ether-a-go-go-related
      potassium channel (hERG) inhibitors by aligning compounds to them or by guiding
      the docking of compounds in the binding site. A molecular dynamics optimized
      structure of hERG led to improved predictions using either compound alignment to 
      the Atlas ligand or docking. The structure was also found to be suitable to
      define a strategy for lowering inhibition based on the proposed binding mode of
      compounds in the channel.

TI  - Systematic review of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K
      antagonists in left ventricular thrombus.
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.14084 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) increases the risk of thrombotic events and
      mortality. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) used to treat LVT have several known
      risks, as a result of which direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use has recently
      increased. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOACs and VKAs in
      treating LVT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library
      trials, and Web of Science databases for studies published before 19 April 2022, 
      involving DOAC versus VKA treatment for patients with LVT. This meta-analysis
      comprised 21 studies (total patients, n = 3172; DOAC group, n = 888; VKA group, n
      = 2284). A statistically significant reduction in bleeding events was observed in
      patients on DOACs vs. those on VKAs (risk ratio (RR) = 0.73, P = 0.004). Patients
      on DOACs residing in North American and European regions and those with ischaemic
      heart disease (IHD) had a significantly lower risk of bleeding events than
      patients residing in other regions or those with a different LVT aetiology,
      respectively (RR = 0.78, P = 0.04; RR = 0.38, P = 0.02; and RR = 0.63, P =
      0.009). A statistically significant reduction in stroke in patients on DOACs
      versus VKAs (RR = 0.72, P = 0.03) was observed, and patients on DOACs residing in
      North America and those with IHD had a significantly lower risk of stroke (RR =
      0.73, P = 0.04, and RR = 0.61, P = 0.03, respectively). Compared with VKAs, DOACs
      are statistically associated with an increase in LVT resolution at 1 month (RR = 
      1.96, P = 0.008). No statistical between-group difference in all-cause mortality 
      (RR = 0.72, P = 0.05), systemic embolism (RR = 0.87, P = 0.74), stroke or
      systemic embolism (RR = 0.90, P = 0.50), and LVT resolution at the end of
      follow-up (RR = 1.06, P = 0.13) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with VKAs,
      DOACs significantly reduce the risk of bleeding events and stroke in LVT
      patients, but mortality was similar in both groups. The advantages are apparent
      not only in patients belonging to the predominantly white residential areas such 
      as North American and European regions but also in patients with LVT due to IHD. 
      DOACs show promising effects in treating LVT compared with VKAs.

TI  - Role of inwardly rectifying K+ channel 5.1 (Kir5.1) in the regulation of renal
      membrane transport.
PG  - 479-485
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000817 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Kir5.1 interacts with Kir4.2 in proximal tubule and with
      Kir4.1 in distal convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT) and cortical
      collecting duct (CCD) to form basolateral-K+-channels. Kir4.2/Kir5.1 and
      Kir4.1/Kir5.1 play an important role in regulating Na+/HCO3--transport of the
      proximal tubule and Na+/K+ -transport in the DCT/CNT/CCD. The main focus of this 
      review is to provide an overview of the recent development in the field regarding
      the role of Kir5.1 regulating renal electrolyte transport in the proximal tubule 
      and DCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Loss-of-function-mutations of KCNJ16 cause a new form
      of tubulopathy, characterized by hypokalaemia, Na+-wasting, acid-base-imbalance
      and metabolic-acidosis. Abnormal bicarbonate transport induced by
      loss-of-function of KCNJ16-mutants is recapitulated in Kir4.2-knockout-(Kir4.2
      KO) mice. Deletion of Kir5.1 also abolishes the effect of dietary Na+ and
      K+-intakes on the basolateral membrane voltage and NCC expression/activity.
      Long-term high-salt intake or high-K+-intake causes hyperkalaemic in
      Kir5.1-deficient mice. SUMMARY: Kir4.2/Kir5.1 activity in the proximal tubule
      plays a key role in regulating Na+, K+ and bicarbonate-transport through
      regulating electrogenic-Na+-bicarbonate-cotransporter-(NBCe1) and type
      3-Na+/H+-exchanger-(NHE3). Kir4.1/Kir5.1 activity of the DCT plays a critical
      role in mediating the effect of dietary-K+ and Na+-intakes on NCC
      activity/expression. As NCC determines the Na+ delivery rate to the
      aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN), defective regulation of NCC during
      high-salt and high-K+ compromises renal K+ excretion and K+ homeostasis.

TI  - Transcriptome and Metabonomic Analysis of Tamarix ramosissima Potassium (K+)
      Channels and Transporters in Response to NaCl Stress.
LID - 1313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081313 [doi]
AB  - Potassium ion (K(+)) channels and transporters are key components of plant K(+)
      absorption and transportation and play an important role in plant growth and
      development. This study revealed that K(+) channels and transporters are involved
      in the salt tolerance molecular mechanism and metabolites of the halophyte
      representative plant Tamarix&amp;nbsp;ramosissima (T. ramosissima) in response to
      NaCl stress, providing a theoretical basis for the mitigation of salt stress
      using halophytes. Through transcriptome sequencing and metabolite detection
      analysis of 0 h, 48 h and 168 h by applying exogenous K(+) to the roots of T.
      ramosissima under NaCl stress, 15 high-quality Clean Data bases were obtained,
      Q20 reached more than 97%, Q30 reached more than 92%, and GC content reached
      44.5%, which is in line with further bioinformatics analysis. Based on the Liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the roots of T. ramosissima
      were exposed to exogenous potassium for 48 h and 168 h under NaCl stress, and
      1510 and 1124 metabolites were identified in positive and negative ion mode,
      respectively. Through orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant
      analysis (OPLS-DA) model analysis, its metabolomic data have excellent
      predictability and stability. The results of this study showed that there were 37
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) annotated as Class 2 K(+) channels
      (Shaker-like K(+) channel and TPK channel) and Class 3 K(+) transporters
      (HAK/KUP/KT, HKT and CPAs transporter families). Among them, 29 DEGs were
      annotated to the gene ontology (GO) database, and the most genes were involved in
      the GO Biological Process. In addition, the expression levels of Unigene0014342
      in the HAK/KUP/KT transporter and Unigene0088276 and Unigene0103067 in the CPAs
      transporter both first decreased and then increased when treated with 200 mM NaCl
      for 48 h and 168 h. However, when treated with 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl for 48 h
      and 168 h, a continuous upward trend was shown. Notably, the expression level of 
      Unigene0016813 in CPAS transporter continued to increase when treated with 200 mM
      NaCl and 200 mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl for 48 h and 168 h. 3 DEGs, Unigene0088276,
      Unigene0016813 and Unigene0103067, were dominated by the positive regulation of
      their related metabolites, and this correlation was significant. The results
      showed that these DEGs increased the absorption of K(+) and the ratio of
      K(+)/Na(+) under NaCl stress at 48 h and 168 h after adding exogenous potassium
      and enhanced the salt tolerance of T. ramosissima. Notably, the expression level 
      of Unigene0103067 in the CPAs transporter was consistently upregulated when 200
      mM NaCl + 10 mM KCl was treated for 48 h and 168 h. The positive regulatory
      metabolites were always dominant, which better helped T. ramosissima resist salt 
      stress. Unigene0103067 plays an important role in enhancing the salt tolerance of
      T. ramosissima and reducing the toxicity of NaCl in roots. Additionally,
      phylogenetic tree analysis showed that Unigene0103067 and
      Reaumuria&amp;nbsp;trigyna had the closest genetic distance in the evolutionary
      relationship. Finally, 9 DEGs were randomly selected for quantitative real-time
      PCR (qRT-PCR) verification. Their expression trends were completely consistent
      with the transcriptome sequencing analysis results, proving that this study's
      data are accurate and reliable. This study provides resources for revealing the
      molecular mechanism of NaCl stress tolerance in T. ramosissima and lays a
      theoretical foundation for cultivating new salt-tolerant varieties.

      problem being analyzed, because they can extract knowledge from a set of
      investigated data. Thus, this work proposes applying an evolving fuzzy neural
      network capable of solving data stream regression problems with considerable
      interpretability. The dataset is based on a necessary prediction of k barriers
      with wireless sensors to identify unauthorized persons entering a protected
      territory. Our method was empirically compared with state-of-the-art evolving
      methods, showing significantly lower RMSE values for separate test data sets and 
      also lower accumulated mean absolute errors (MAEs) when evaluating the methods in
      a stream-based interleaved-predict-and-then-update procedure. In addition, the
      model could offer relevant information in terms of interpretable fuzzy rules,
      allowing an explainable evaluation of the regression problems contained in the
      data streams.

AB  - Pathologies of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have been linked to a multitude of
      central nervous system (CNS) disorders whose pathology is poorly understood.
      Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been postulated to be involved in
      the underlying mechanisms of these disease states, yet a complete understanding
      remains elusive. This study seeks to utilize an in vitro model of the blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) with brain endothelial cell (b.End3) murine endothelioma cells to
      investigate the role of CSD in BBB pathology by characterizing effects of the
      release of major pronociceptive substances into the extracellular space of the
      CNS. The application of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) screening,
      transcellular uptake, and immunoreactive methods were used in concert with global
      proteome and phospho-proteomic approaches to assess the effect of modeled CSD
      events on the modeled BBB in vitro. The findings demonstrate relocalization and
      functional alteration to proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton and
      endothelial tight junctions. Additionally, unique pathologic mechanisms induced
      by individual substances released during CSD were found to have unique
      phosphorylation signatures in phospho-proteome analysis, identifying Zona
      Occludins 1 (ZO-1) as a possible pathologic "checkpoint" of the BBB. By utilizing
      these phosphorylation signatures, possible novel diagnostic methods may be
      developed for CSD and warrants further investigation.

TI  - Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Test the Effects of a
      Nutraceutical Combination Monacolin K-Free on the Lipid and Inflammatory Profile 
      of Subjects with Hypercholesterolemia.
LID - 2812 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutraceutical combinations (NCs) against hypercholesterolemia are
      increasing in the marketplace. However, the availability of NCs without monacolin
      K is scarce even though the statin-intolerant population needs it. METHODS: This 
      study is a parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. We
      evaluated the effects of the NC containing phytosterols, bergamot, olive fruits, 
      and vitamin K2 on lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers in 118 subjects (mean
      age +/- SD, 57.9 +/- 8.8 years; 49 men and 69 women) with hypercholesterolemia
      (mean total cholesterol +/- SD, 227.4 +/- 20.8 mg/dL) without clinical history of
      cardiovascular diseases. At baseline and 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, we
      evaluated lipid profile (total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides),
      safety (liver, kidney, and muscle parameters), and inflammatory biomarkers such
      as hs-CRP, leukocytes, interleukin-32, and interleukin-38 and
      inflammatory-microRNAs (miRs) miR-21, miR-126, and miR-146a. RESULTS: Compared to
      the placebo, at 6 and 12 weeks, NC did not significantly reduce total cholesterol
      (p = 0.083), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.150), and triglycerides (p = 0.822). No
      changes were found in hs-CRP (p = 0.179), interleukin-32 (p = 0.587),
      interleukin-38 (p = 0.930), miR-21 (p = 0.275), miR-126 (p = 0.718), miR-146a (p 
      = 0.206), myoglobin (p = 0.164), and creatine kinase (p = 0.376). Among the two
      reported, only one adverse event was probably related to the nutraceutical
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated nutraceutical combination did not change
      serum lipid profile and inflammatory parameters, at least not with the daily dose
      applied in the present study.

TI  - Multipath/NLOS Detection Based on K-Means Clustering for GNSS/INS Tightly Coupled
      System in Urban Areas.
LID - 1128 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13071128 [doi]
AB  - Due to the massive multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal
      receptions, the accuracy and reliability of GNSS positioning solution can be
      severely degraded in a highly urbanized area, which has a negative impact on the 
      performance of GNSS/INS integrated navigation. Therefore, this paper proposes a
      multipath/NLOS detection method based on the K-means clustering algorithm for
      vehicle GNSS/INS integrated positioning. It comprehensively considers different
      feature parameters derived from GNSS raw observations, such as the
      satellite-elevation angle, carrier-to-noise ratio, pseudorange residual, and
      pseudorange rate consistency to effectively classify GNSS signals. In view of the
      influence of different GNSS signals on positioning results, the K-means
      clustering algorithm is exploited to divide the observation data into two main
      categories: direct signals and indirect signals (including multipath and NLOS
      signals). Then, the multipath/NLOS signal is separated from the observation data.
      Finally, this paper uses the measured vehicle GNSS/INS observation data,
      including offline dataset and online dataset, to verify the accuracy of signal
      classification based on double-differenced pseudorange positioning. A series of
      experiments conducted in typical urban scenarios demonstrate that the proposed
      method could ameliorate the positioning accuracy significantly compared with the 
      conventional GNSS/INS integrated navigation. After excluding GNSS outliers, the
      positioning accuracy of the offline dataset is improved by 16% and 85% in the
      horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, and the positioning accuracy of
      the online dataset is improved by 21% and 41% in the two directions. This method 
      does not rely on external geographic information data and other sensors, which
      has better practicability and environmental adaptability.

TI  - The First Evaluation of Proteinase K-Resistant Prion Protein (PrP(Sc)) in Korean 
      Appendix Specimens.
LID - 947 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070947 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders
      caused by the abnormal proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrP(Sc)). Since
      variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was first reported in the United Kingdom 
      (UK) in 1996, the occurrence of variant CJD has been reported in over 10
      countries. To date, variant CJD has not been reported in Korea. However, the
      E211K somatic mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP), which is related to
      bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was reported in Korean Holstein cattle,
      and atypical BSE, which is supposed to be sporadic BSE, has been occurring in
      many countries, including Japan and the USA. These results suggest that BSE may
      occur naturally in Korea. Thus, we performed a preemptive PrP(Sc) test in
      appendix specimens to diagnose variant CJD in a Korean population. Materials and 
      Methods: In the present study, we investigated CJD-related mutations and
      polymorphisms of the PRNP gene and carried out an examination on PrP(Sc) in
      appendix specimens of Korean patients after appendectomy. Results: In all Korean 
      appendix specimens tested, PrP(Sc) bands were not detected. Conclusion: To the
      best of our knowledge, this was the first evaluation of PrP(Sc) in Korean
      appendix specimens.

TI  - Anti-Adherence and Antimicrobial Activities of Silver Nanoparticles against
      Serotypes C and K of Streptococcus mutans on Orthodontic Appliances.
LID - 877 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070877 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the main
      microorganism associated with the presence of dental caries and specific
      serotypes of this bacteria have been related to several systemic diseases
      limiting general health. In orthodontics, white spot lesions (WSL), represent a
      great challenge for clinicians due to the great fluctuation of their prevalence
      and incidence during conventional orthodontic treatments. Although silver
      nanoparticles (AgNP) have been demonstrated to have great antimicrobial
      properties in several microorganisms, including S. mutans bacteria, there is no
      available information about anti adherence and antimicrobial properties of AgNP
      exposed to two of the most relevant serotypes of S. mutans adhered on orthodontic
      materials used for conventional therapeutics. The objective of this study was to 
      determine anti-adherence and antimicrobial levels of AgNP against serotypes c and
      k of S. mutans on conventional orthodontic appliances. Materials and Methods: An 
      AgNP solution was prepared and characterized using dispersion light scattering
      (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Antimicrobial and
      anti-adherence activities of AgNP were determined using minimal inhibitory
      concentrations (MIC) and bacterial adherence testing against serotypes c and k of
      S. mutans clinically isolated and confirmed by PCR assay. Results: The prepared
      AgNP had spherical shapes with a good size distribution (29.3 +/- 0.7 nm) with
      negative and well-defined electrical charges (-36.5 +/- 5.7 mV). AgNP had good
      bacterial growth (55.7 +/- 19.3 microg/mL for serotype c, and 111.4 +/- 38.6
      microg/mL for serotype k) and adherence inhibitions for all bacterial strains and
      orthodontic wires (p &lt; 0.05). The serotype k showed statistically the highest 
      microbial adherence (p &lt; 0.05). The SS wires promoted more bacterial adhesion 
      (149.0 +/- 253.6 UFC/mL x 10(4)) than CuNiTi (3.3 +/- 6.0 UFC/mL x 10(4)) and
      NiTi (101.1 +/- 108.5 UFC/mL x 10(4)) arches. SEM analysis suggests CuNiTi wires 
      demonstrated better topographical conditions for bacterial adherence while AFM
      evaluation determined cell wall irregularities in bacterial cells exposed to
      AgNP. Conclusions: This study suggests the widespread use of AgNP as a potential 
      anti-adherent and antimicrobial agent for the prevention of WSL during
      conventional orthodontic therapies and, collaterally, other systemic diseases.

TI  - Testis-Specific Isoform of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase and Regulation of Bull Fertility.
LID - 7936 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147936 [doi]
AB  - An advanced understanding of sperm function is relevant for evidence-based male
      fertility prediction and addressing male infertility. A standard breeding
      soundness evaluation (BSE) merely identifies gross abnormalities in bulls,
      whereas selection based on single nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic estimated 
      breeding values overlooks sub-microscopic differences in sperm. Molecular tools
      are important for validating genomic selection and advancing knowledge on the
      regulation of male fertility at an interdisciplinary level. Therefore, research
      in this field is now focused on developing a combination of in vitro sperm
      function tests and identifying biomarkers such as sperm proteins with critical
      roles in fertility. The Na(+)-K(+) ATPase is a ubiquitous transmembrane protein
      and its alpha4 isoform (ATP1A4) is exclusively expressed in germ cells and sperm.
      Furthermore, ATP1A4 is essential for male fertility, as it interacts with
      signaling molecules in both raft and non-raft fractions of the sperm plasma
      membrane to regulate capacitation-associated signaling, hyperactivation,
      sperm-oocyte interactions, and activation. Interestingly, ATP1A4 activity and
      expression increase during capacitation, challenging the widely accepted dogma of
      sperm translational quiescence. This review discusses the literature on the role 
      of ATP1A4 during capacitation and fertilization events and its prospective use in
      improving male fertility prediction.

TI  - Characterization in Inhibitory Effectiveness of Carbamazepine in Voltage-Gated
      Na(+) and Erg-Mediated K(+) Currents in a Mouse Neural Crest-Derived (Neuro-2a)
      Cell Line.
LID - 7892 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147892 [doi]
AB  - Carbamazepine (CBZ, Tegretol((R))) is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of 
      epilepsy and neuropathic pain; however, several unwanted effects of this drug
      have been noticed. Therefore, the regulatory actions of CBZ on ionic currents in 
      electrically excitable cells need to be reappraised, although its efficacy in
      suppressing voltage-gated Na(+) current (INa) has been disclosed. This study was 
      undertaken to explore the modifications produced by CBZ on ionic currents (e.g., 
      INa and erg-mediated K(+) current [IK(erg)]) measured from Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. 
      In these cells, we found that this drug differentially suppressed the peak
      (transient, INa(T)) and sustained (late, INa(L)) components of INa in a
      concentration-dependent manner with effective IC50 of 56 and 18 muM,
      respectively. The overall current-voltage relationship of INa(T) with or without 
      the addition of CBZ remained unchanged; however, the strength (i.e., area) in the
      window component of INa (INa(W)) evoked by the short ascending ramp pulse (Vramp)
      was overly lessened in the CBZ presence. Tefluthrin (Tef), a synthetic
      pyrethroid, known to stimulate INa, augmented the strength of the
      voltage-dependent hysteresis (Hys(V)) of persistent INa (INa(P)) in response to
      the isosceles-triangular Vramp; moreover, further application of CBZ attenuated
      Tef-mediated accentuation of INa(P)'s Hys(V). With a two-step voltage protocol,
      the recovery of INa(T) inactivation seen in Neuro-2a cells became progressively
      slowed by adding CBZ; however, the cumulative inhibition of INa(T) evoked by
      pulse train stimulation was enhanced during exposure to this drug. Neuro-2a-cell 
      exposure to CBZ (100 muM), the magnitude of erg-mediated K(+) current measured
      throughout the entire voltage-clamp steps applied was mildly inhibited. The
      docking results regarding the interaction of CBZ and voltage-gate Na(+) (NaV)
      channel predicted the ability of CBZ to bind to some amino-acid residues in NaV
      due to the existence of a hydrogen bond or hydrophobic contact. It is conceivable
      from the current investigations that the INa (INa(T), INa(L), INa(W), and INa(P))
      residing in Neuro-2a cells are susceptible to being suppressed by CBZ, and that
      its block on INa(L) is larger than that on INa(T). Collectively, the magnitude
      and gating of NaV channels produced by the CBZ presence might have an impact on
      its anticonvulsant and analgesic effects occurring in vivo.

TI  - The beta2-Subunit (AMOG) of Human Na(+), K(+)-ATPase Is a Homophilic Adhesion
      Molecule.
LID - 7753 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147753 [doi]
AB  - The beta2 subunit of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase was originally identified as the adhesion
      molecule on glia (AMOG) that mediates the adhesion of astrocytes to neurons in
      the central nervous system and that is implicated in the regulation of neurite
      outgrowth and neuronal migration. While beta1 isoform have been shown to
      trans-interact in a species-specific mode with the beta1 subunit on the
      epithelial neighboring cell, the beta2 subunit has been shown to act as a
      recognition molecule on the glia. Nevertheless, none of the works have identified
      the binding partner of beta2 or described its adhesion mechanism. Until now, the 
      interactions pronounced for beta2/AMOG are heterophilic cis-interactions. In the 
      present report we designed experiments that would clarify whether beta2 is a
      cell-cell homophilic adhesion molecule. For this purpose, we performed protein
      docking analysis, cell-cell aggregation, and protein-protein interaction assays. 
      We observed that the glycosylated extracellular domain of beta2/AMOG can make an 
      energetically stable trans-interacting dimer. We show that CHO (Chinese Hamster
      Ovary) fibroblasts transfected with the human beta2 subunit become more adhesive 
      and make large aggregates. The treatment with Tunicamycin in vivo reduced cell
      aggregation, suggesting the participation of N-glycans in that process.
      Protein-protein interaction assay in vivo with MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney)
      or CHO cells expressing a recombinant beta2 subunit show that the beta2 subunits 
      on the cell surface of the transfected cell lines interact with each other.
      Overall, our results suggest that the human beta2 subunit can form trans-dimers
      between neighboring cells when expressed in non-astrocytic cells, such as
      fibroblasts (CHO) and epithelial cells (MDCK).

TI  - Barriers to COVID-19 Intervention Implementation in K-5 Classrooms: A Survey of
      Teachers from a District with Mask Mandates despite a Statewide Mask Mandate Ban.
LID - 8311 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148311 [doi]
AB  - The study objective was to characterize K-5 teachers' risk perceptions and
      experiences with CDC COVID-19 classroom guidance in an Arizona school district
      with a mask mandate, conflicting with a statewide mask mandate ban. METHODS:
      Public school teachers (n = 111) were recruited between 14 December 2021, and 31 
      January 2022, for an anonymous online survey with questions on seven important
      topics related to: (1) population demographics, (2) teachers' perceptions of
      COVID-19 in the workplace, (3) masks, (4) physical distancing, (5) surface
      transmission routes, (6) air flow, and (7) contact tracing protocols. Descriptive
      statistics were calculated, and statistically significant differences in
      categorical responses by grade level taught were investigated with Fisher's exact
      test. RESULTS: There were 76 complete responses. No significant differences
      across grade levels were found. More than half (53%, 43/81) reported not feeling 
      protected from occupational COVID-19 exposure. Lack of mask usage/enforcement was
      the most frequently listed reason (40%, 17/42). Physical distancing barriers
      included large student-teacher ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent mask guidance at
      state and local levels, increased financial support, and lower student-teacher
      ratios may improve the implementation of CDC guidance for classrooms. Conflicting
      statewide and district-level school mask policies may negatively impact teachers'
      risk perceptions.

TI  - Genome-Wide Analysis of the GDSL Genes in Pecan (Carya illinoensis K. Koch):
      Phylogeny, Structure, Promoter Cis-Elements, Co-Expression Networks, and Response
      to Salt Stresses.
LID - 1103 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071103 [doi]
AB  - The Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu (GDSL)-lipase family is a large subfamily of lipolytic
      enzymes that plays an important role in plant growth and defense against
      environmental stress. However, little is known about their function in pecans
      (Carya illinoensis K. Koch). In this study, 87 CilGDSLs were identified and
      divided into 2 groups and 12 subgroups using phylogenetic analysis; members of
      the same sub-branch had conserved gene structure and motif composition. The
      majority of the genes had four introns and were composed of an alpha-helix and a 
      beta-strand. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that these genes were
      localized in the extracellular matrix, chloroplasts, cytoplasm, nucleus, vacuole,
      and endoplasmic reticulum, and were validated by transient expression in tobacco 
      mesophyll cells. Furthermore, the analysis of the promoter cis-elements for the
      CilGDSLs revealed the presence of plant anaerobic induction regulatory, abscisic 
      acid response, light response elements, jasmonic acid (JA) response elements,
      etc. The qRT-PCR analysis results in "Pawnee" with salt treatment showed that the
      CilGDSL42.93 (leaf) and CilGDSL39.88 (root) were highly expressed in different
      tissues. After salt stress treatment, isobaric tags for relative and absolute
      quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis revealed the presence of a total of ten GDSL
      proteins. Moreover, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
      showed that one set of co-expressed genes (module), primarily CilGDSL41.11,
      CilGDSL39.49, CilGDSL34.85, and CilGDSL41.01, was significantly associated with
      salt stress in leaf. In short, some of them were shown to be involved in plant
      defense against salt stress in this study.

TI  - Decision of Anticoagulation in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in the Real World 
      in the Non-Antivitamin K Anticoagulants Era.
LID - 1333 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10071333 [doi]
AB  - Background. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have five times 
      higher risk of stroke than the general population. Anticoagulation (ACO) in NVAF 
      is a class I indication after assessing the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores.
      However, in the real world, NVAF patients receive less ACO than needed due to
      patients' comorbidities that can be assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index
      (CCI). The use of non-antivitamin K anticoagulants (NOAC) has improved the
      decision to anticoagulate. Objective. We analyzed the factors influencing the ACO
      prescribing decision in NVAF patients in the real world and the changes induced
      by the introduction of NOAC. Method. We carried out an observational
      retrospective cross-sectional study that included consecutive patients with
      permanent NVAF and CHA2DS2-VASc >/= 2, admitted to a community hospital between
      2010-2011 (group 1, 286 patients), when only vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were
      used, and 2018-2019 (group 2, 433 patients), respectively. We calculated
      CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, and CCI and recorded the ACO decision and the use of VKA 
      or NOAC in group 2. We compared the calculated scores between ACO and
      non-anticoagulated (nonACO) patients in both groups and between groups. Results. 
      A 31.5% share of patients in group 1 and 12.9% in group 2 did not receive ACO
      despite a CHA2DS2-VASc score >/= 2. In group 1, nonACO patients had higher
      HAS-BLED and CCI scores than the ACO patients, but their CHA2DS2-VASc scores were
      not significantly different. Old age, dementia, severe chronic kidney disease,
      neoplasia, and anemia were the most frequent reasons not to prescribe
      anticoagulants. In group 2, more nonACO patients had dementia, diabetes mellitus,
      and higher HAS-BLED than ACO patients. Moderate-severe CKD, neoplasia with
      metastasis, liver disease, anemia, and diabetes mellitus were statistically
      significantly more frequent in nonACO patients from group 1 than those from group
      2. In group 2, 55.7% of ACO patients received NOAC. Conclusions. In real-world
      clinical practice, the decision for anticoagulation in NVAF is influenced by
      patient age, comorbidities, and risk of bleeding, and many patients do not
      receive anticoagulants despite a high CHA2DS2-VASc score. The use of NOAC in the 
      past few years has improved treatment decisions. At the same time, the correct
      diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of comorbidities have cut down the risk of
      bleeding and allowed anticoagulant use according to guidelines.

AB  - Melanoma, a very severe form of skin cancer, spreads quickly and has a high
      mortality rate if not treated early. Recently, machine learning, deep learning,
      and other related technologies have been successfully applied to computer-aided
      diagnostic tasks of skin lesions. However, some issues in terms of image feature 
      extraction and imbalanced data need to be addressed. Based on a method for
      manually annotating image features by dermatologists, we developed a melanoma
      detection model with four improvement strategies, including applying the transfer
      learning technique to automatically extract image features, adding gender and age

TI  - Application of Statistical K-Means Algorithm for University Academic Evaluation.
LID - 1004 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24071004 [doi]
AB  - With the globalization of higher education, academic evaluation is increasingly
      valued by the scientific and educational circles. Although the number of
      published papers of academic evaluation methods is increasing, previous research 
      mainly focused on the method of assigning different weights for various
      indicators, which can be subjective and limited. This paper investigates the
      evaluation of academic performance by using the statistical K-means (SKM)
      algorithm to produce clusters. The core idea is mapping the evaluation data from 
      Euclidean space to Riemannian space in which the geometric structure can be used 
      to obtain accurate clustering results. The method can adapt to different
      indicators and make full use of big data. By using the K-means algorithm based on
      statistical manifolds, the academic evaluation results of universities can be
      obtained. Furthermore, through simulation experiments on the top 20 universities 
      of China with the traditional K-means, GMM and SKM algorithms, respectively, we
      analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. We also test the
      three algorithms on a UCI ML dataset. The simulation results show the advantages 
      of the SKM algorithm.

TI  - Interaction Interface of Abeta42 with Human Na,K-ATPase Studied by MD and ITC and
      Inhibitor Screening by MD.
LID - 1663 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071663 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease accompanied by
      progressive cognitive and memory dysfunction due to disruption of normal
      electrotonic properties of neurons and neuronal loss. The Na,K-ATPase interaction
      with beta amyloid (Abeta) plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. It has been
      shown that Na,K-ATPase activity in the AD brain was significantly lower than
      those in age-matched control brain. The interaction of Abeta42 with Na,K-ATPase
      and subsequent oligomerization leads to inhibition of the enzyme activity. In
      this study interaction interfaces between three common Abeta42 isoforms, and
      different conformations of human Na,K-ATPase (alpha1beta1) have been obtained
      using molecular modeling, including docking and molecular dynamics (MD).
      Interaction sites of Na,K-ATPase with Abeta42 are localized between extracellular
      parts of alpha- and beta- subunits and are practically identical for Na,K-ATPase 
      at different conformations. Thermodynamic parameters for the formation of
      Na,K-ATPase:Abeta42 complex at different conformations acquired by isothermal
      titration calorimetry (ITC) are similar, which is in line with the data of
      molecular modeling. Similarity of Na,K-ATPase interaction interfaces with Abeta
      in all conformations allowed us to cross-screen potential inhibitors for this
      interaction and find pharmaceutical compounds that could block it.

TI  - Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) and King-Devick (K-D) Performance in Multiple
      Sclerosis.
LID - 954 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12070954 [doi]
AB  - Eye movement disorders have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis
      (MS) as saccadic disturbances. Several methods have been described for the
      assessment of saccades, including the K-D and DEM tests. The performance of these
      tests also involves attention, language, and other brain areas which have been
      reported to be altered in MS patients. The aim of the study was to determine how 
      developmental eye movement (DEM) and King-Devick (K-D) tests are affected in
      MS-patients. It was also to analyze whether a resolved episode of optic neuritis 
      (ON) has a negative influence. Subjects with MS showed worse outcomes (higher
      times) in DEM test (72 (26) s and a K-D test (56 (22) s compared to healthy
      subjects (64 (7) s and 55 (11) s, respectively). However, a previous ON episode
      did not worsen the MS-times of DEM (80 (33) s or of K-D (62 (33) s. Horizontal
      saccades with the DEM showed differences between subjects with MS (with and
      without ON) and healthy ones (p &lt; 0.05), whereas no such differences were
      found in the vertical saccades. According to the DEM instructions, MS patients
      would present heterogeneous oculomotor and non-visual disturbances. Regarding the
      K-D test, only the third card (the most complex one) showed differences (p &lt;
      0.05) between groups. These tests can capture impairment of attention, language, 
      and other areas that correlate with suboptimal brain function in addition to the 
      oculomotor dysfunctions present in subjects with MS.

TI  - Selenoprotein K Is Essential for the Migration and Phagocytosis of Immature
      Dendritic Cells.
LID - 1264 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071264 [doi]
AB  - Selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is an endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-regulated
      protein required for the calcium (Ca(2+)) flux-mediated migration of T cells and 
      neutrophils, and the migration and phagocytosis of macrophages and microglia.
      However, the effect of SELENOK on the regulation of the immune function of
      dendritic cells (DCs), including immature DCs (imDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs), is
      still unclear. In this study, imDCs prepared from SELENOK knockout mice were used
      to evaluate the effect of SELENOK on the migration and phagocytosis of imDCs. The
      results showed that ERS-induced downregulation of imDCs phenotypic markers led to
      a reduction in Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)-dependent migration and
      enhanced Ca(2+)/CD205-mediated phagocytosis. SELENOK deficiency-induced
      upregulation of selenoprotein S (SELENOS) attenuated ERS levels in imDCs. An
      increase in Ca(2+) levels resulted in increased migration and decreased
      phagocytosis with or without ERS conditions. The migration was RhoA-dependent,
      and Ca(2+) or CD205 was associated with regulating phagocytosis in imDCs. Our
      study found that SELENOK is required for imDC migration and phagocytosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) remains an essential option for venous
      thromboembolism (VTE), although direct oral anticoagulants have become available.
      However, there is a paucity of data on the optimal intensity and quality of
      control for VKA in Japanese. METHODS: The COMMAND VTE Registry is a multicenter
      registry enrolling consecutive 3027 patients with acute symptomatic VTE among 29 
      centers in Japan. The current study population consisted of 1938 patients who
      received VKA with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR)
      measurement >5 times. The primary outcome measure was a composite of symptomatic 
      VTE recurrence or major bleeding at 1year. The presumed optimal quality of VKA
      therapy was defined as the combination of PT-INR range and time in therapeutic
      range (TTR) with the numerically lowest event rate. RESULTS: The group with TTR
      >/=70% based on PT-INR range >/=1.5 and <2.0 showed the lowest cumulative
      incidence rate. The cumulative 1-year incidence and the adjusted risk for the
      primary outcome measure were significantly lower in the optimal quality group
      than in the non-optimal quality group (5.2% vs. 11.7%, p=0.001, and HR 0.49,
      95%CI 0.28-0.81). Similarly, the cumulative 1-year incidences of a recurrent VTE,
      major bleeding, and all-cause death were significantly lower in the optimal
      quality group (recurrent VTE: 2.5% vs. 6.0%, p=0.02; major bleeding: 2.8% vs.
      7.0%, p=0.008; and all-cause death: 2.8% vs. 12.6%, p<0.0001). The lower risk of 
      the optimal quality group relative to non-optimal quality group for the clinical 
      outcomes was consistent regardless of the etiology of VTE (active cancer,
      transient risk factor, and unprovoked). CONCLUSIONS: The current VTE registry
      showed the optimal intensity of VKA therapy was target PT-INR range >/=1.5 and
      <2.0, which could support the current Japanese guideline recommendation, and the 
      good quality of control for VKA therapy of TTR >/=70% was independently
      associated with better outcomes.

AB  - Granzyme K (GzmK) is a tryptic member of the granzyme family of chymotrypsin-like
      serine proteases produced by cells of the immune system. Previous studies have
      indicated that GzmK activates protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) enhancing
      activation of monocytes and wound healing in endothelial cells. Here, we show
      using peptides and full length proteins that GzmK and, to a lesser extent the
      related protease GzmA, are capable of activating PAR1 and PAR2. These cleavage
      events occur at the canonical arginine P1 residue and involve exosite
      interactions between protease and receptor. Despite cleaving PAR2 at the same
      point as trypsin, GzmK does not induce a classical Ca2+ flux but instead
      activates a distinct signalling cascade, involving recruitment of beta-arrestin
      and phosphorylation of ERK. In epithelial A549 cells, PAR2 activation by GzmK
      results in the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These data
      suggest that during an immune response GzmK acts as a pro-inflammatory regulator,
      rather than as a cytotoxin.

TI  - Molecular determinants for the high-affinity blockade of hERG K+ channel by
      tolterodine.
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000001336 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Tolterodine is a first-line antimuscarinic drug used to treat
      overactive bladder. Adverse cardiac effects including tachycardia and
      palpitations have been observed, presumably due to its inhibition of the human
      ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel. However, the molecular mechanism of
      hERG channel inhibition by tolterodine is largely unclear. In this study we
      performed molecular docking to identify potential binding sites of tolterodine in
      hERG channel, and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp to record the currents of hERG
      and its mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The results of computational
      modelling demonstrated that phenylalanine at position 656 (F656) and tyrosine at 
      position 652 (Y652) on the S6 helix of hERG channel are the most favourable
      binding residues of tolterodine, which was validated by electrophysiological
      recordings on Y652A and F656A hERG mutants. The Y652A and F656A mutations
      decreased inhibitory potency of tolterodine 345-fold and 126-fold, respectively. 
      The Y652A mutation significantly altered the voltage dependence of channel
      inhibition by tolterodine. For both the wildtype and mutant channels, tolterodine
      reduced the currents in a time-dependent manner, and the blockade occurred with
      the channel activated. Tolterodine did not interfere with hERG channel
      deactivation, whereas channel inactivation greatly impaired its blocking effect. 
      The inhibition of hERG channel by tolterodine is independent of its action on
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In conclusion, tolterodine is an open-state
      blocker of hERG K+ channel with nanomolar potency. Y652 and F656, two aromatic
      residues on the inner S6 helix, are responsible for the high-affinity binding of 
      tolterodine to hERG channel.

AB  - In transition metal dichalcogenides, valley depolarization through intervalley
      carrier scattering by zone-edge phonons is often unavoidable. Although valley
      depolarization processes related to various acoustic phonons have been suggested,
      their optical verification is still vague due to nearly degenerate phonon
      frequencies on acoustic phonon branches at zone-edge momentums. Here we report an
      unambiguous phonon momentum determination of the longitudinal acoustic (LA)
      phonons at the K point, which are responsible for the ultrafast valley
      depolarization in monolayer MoSe2. Using sub-10-fs-resolution pump-probe
      spectroscopy, we observed coherent phonons signals at both even and odd-orders of
      zone-edge LA mode involved in intervalley carrier scattering process. Our
      phonon-symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations reveal that only the
      LA phonon at the K point, as opposed to the M point, can produce experimental
      odd-order LA phonon signals from its nonlinear optical modulation. This work will
      provide momentum-resolved descriptions of phonon-carrier intervalley scattering
      processes in valleytronic materials.

TI  - General Pharmacological Activation Mechanism of K(+) Channels Bypassing Channel
      Gates.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c02115 [doi]
AB  - Under the known pharmacological activation mechanisms, activators allosterically 
      or directly open potassium channel gates. However, herein, molecular dynamics
      simulations on TREK-1, a member of the channel class gated at the filter,
      suggested that negatively charged activators act with a gate-independent
      mechanism where compounds increase currents by promoting ions passing through the
      central cavity. Then, based on studies of KCNQ2, we uncovered that this
      noncanonical activation mechanism is shared by the other channel class gated at
      the helix-bundle crossing. Rational drug design found a novel KCNQ2 agonist,
      CLE030, which stably binds to the central cavity. Functional analysis, molecular 
      dynamics simulations, and calculations of the potential of mean force revealed
      that the carbonyl oxygen of CLE030 influences permeant ions in the central cavity
      to contribute to its activation effects. Together, this study discovered a
      ligand-to-ion activation mechanism for channels that bypasses their gates and
      thus is conserved across subfamilies with different gates.

TI  - Assessing Cognitive Factors of Modular Distance Learning of K-12 Students Amidst 
      the COVID-19 Pandemic towards Academic Achievements and Satisfaction.
LID - 200 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bs12070200 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought extraordinary challenges to K-12 students in using 
      modular distance learning. According to Transactional Distance Theory (TDT),
      which is defined as understanding the effects of distance learning in the
      cognitive domain, the current study constructs a theoretical framework to measure
      student satisfaction and Bloom's Taxonomy Theory (BTT) to measure students'
      academic achievements. This study aims to evaluate and identify the possible
      cognitive capacity influencing K-12 students' academic achievements and
      satisfaction with modular distance learning during this new phenomenon. A survey 
      questionnaire was completed through an online form by 252 K-12 students from the 
      different institutions of Occidental Mindoro. Using Structural Equation Modeling 
      (SEM), the researcher analyses the relationship between the dependent and
      independent variables. The model used in this research illustrates cognitive
      factors associated with adopting modular distance learning based on students'
      academic achievements and satisfaction. The study revealed that students'
      background, experience, behavior, and instructor interaction positively affected 
      their satisfaction. While the effects of the students' performance,
      understanding, and perceived effectiveness were wholly aligned with their
      academic achievements. The findings of the model with solid support of the
      integrative association between TDT and BTT theories could guide decision-makers 
      in institutions to implement, evaluate, and utilize modular distance learning in 
      their education systems.

      growing protein complex at the inner segments of mammalian photoreceptors.
PG  - 448
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04409-9 [doi]
AB  - The RS1 gene on Xp 22.13 encodes retinoschisin which is known to directly
      interact with the retinal Na/K-ATPase at the photoreceptor inner segments.
      Pathologic mutations in RS1 cause X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS), a
      hereditary retinal dystrophy in young males. To further delineate the
      retinoschisin-Na/K-ATPase complex, co-immunoprecipitation was performed with
      porcine and murine retinal lysates targeting the ATP1A3 subunit. This identified 
      the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunits Kv2.1 and Kv8.2 as direct
      interaction partners of the retinal Na/K-ATPase. Colocalization of the individual
      components of the complex was demonstrated at the membrane of photoreceptor inner
      segments. We further show that retinoschisin-deficiency, a frequent consequence
      of molecular pathology in XLRS, causes mislocalization of the macromolecular
      complex during postnatal retinal development with a simultaneous reduction of
      Kv2.1 and Kv8.2 protein expression, while the level of retinal Na/K-ATPase
      expression remains unaffected. Patch-clamp analysis revealed no effect of
      retinoschisin-deficiency on Kv channel mediated potassium ion currents in vitro. 
      Together, our data suggest that Kv2.1 and Kv8.2 together with retinoschisin and
      the retinal Na/K-ATPase are integral parts of a macromolecular complex at the
      photoreceptor inner segments. Defective compartmentalization of this complex due 
      to retinoschisin-deficiency may be a crucial step in initial XLRS pathogenesis.

      nanocrystals via engineering the interfacial layer.
LID - 10.1039/d2cc02548e [doi]
AB  - Real-time in situ temperature sensing is of significance in the bio-medical
      field; however, the low relative temperature sensitivity Sr is one of the major
      obstacles in the development of nanothermometers. Herein, we provide an effective
      route that engineers the interfacial layer in a core/shell/shell nanostructure to
      enlarge the temperature-dependent luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) variations
      followed by an improved Sr. The CaF2 interlayer is employed to inhibit the
      interaction between the core and outer shell, and increase the interfacial phonon
      energy to enhance the negative thermal quenching effect (TQE) of Nd(3+) ions in
      the outer shell and positive TQE of Er(3+) ions in the core layer. Based on the
      temperature-dependent LIR variations of Er (650 nm) to Nd (800 nm), the maximum
      Sr of 10.01% K(-1) and minimum Sr of % 2.56% K(-1) are achieved.

      Data.

AB  - In the mid-1970s, the first-generation sequencing technique (Sanger) was created.
      It used Advanced BioSystems sequencing devices and Beckman's GeXP genetic testing
      technology. The second-generation sequencing (2GS) technique arrived just several
      years after the first human genome was published in 2003. 2GS devices are very
      quicker than Sanger sequencing equipment, with considerably cheaper manufacturing
      costs and far higher throughput in the form of short reads. The third-generation 
      sequencing (3GS) method, initially introduced in 2005, offers further reduced
      manufacturing costs and higher throughput. Even though sequencing technique has
      result generations, it is error-prone due to a large number of reads. The study
      of this massive amount of data will aid in the decoding of life secrets, the
      detection of infections, the development of improved crops, and the improvement
      of life quality, among other things. This is a challenging task, which is
      complicated not just by a large number of reads and by the occurrence of
      sequencing mistakes. As a result, error correction is a crucial duty in data
      processing; it entails identifying and correcting read errors. Various
      k-spectrum-based error correction algorithms' performance can be influenced by a 
      variety of characteristics like coverage depth, read length, and genome size, as 
      demonstrated in this work. As a result, time and effort must be put into
      selecting acceptable approaches for error correction of certain NGS data.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the potential role of gut microbiota in the
      hepatotoxicity of sodium valproate (SVP) and the protective effect of ginsenoside
      compound K (G-CK) administration against SVP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.
      Measurements of 16S rRNA showed that SVP supplementation led to a 140.749- and
      248.900-fold increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (A.
      muciniphila) and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B. pseudolongum), respectively (p 
      < 0.05). The increase in A. muciniphila was almost completely reversed by G-CK
      treatment. The relative abundance of A. muciniphila was strongly positively
      correlated with aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
      levels (r > 0.78, p < 0.05). The PICRUSt analysis showed that G-CK could inhibit 
      the changes of seven pathways caused by SVP, of which four pathways, including
      the fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and 
      pyruvate metabolism, were found to be negatively correlated with AST and ALT
      levels (r >/= 0.70, p < 0.01 or < 0.05). In addition, the
      glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism were negatively correlated
      with the relative abundance of A. muciniphila (r > 0.65, p < 0.01 or < 0.05).
      This alteration of the gut microbiota composition that resulted in observed
      changes to the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism may be involved
      in both the hepatotoxicity of SVP and the protective effect of G-CK
      administration against SVP-induced hepatotoxicity. Our study provides new
      evidence linking the gut microbiota with SVP-induced hepatotoxicity.

TI  - Seneca Valley Virus 3C (pro) Cleaves Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K to
      Facilitate Viral Replication.
PG  - 945443
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.945443 [doi]
AB  - Seneca Valley virus (SVV) has emerged as an important pathogen that is associated
      with idiopathic vesicular infection in pigs, causing a potential threat to the
      global swine industry. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K)
      that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm plays an important role in viral 
      infection. In this study, we observed that infection with SVV induced cleavage,
      degradation, and cytoplasmic redistribution of hnRNP K in cultured cells, which
      was dependent on the activity of viral 3C(pro) protease. Also, the 3C(pro)
      induced degradation of hnRNP K via the caspase pathway. Further studies
      demonstrated that SVV 3C(pro) cleaved hnRNP K at residue Q364, and the expression
      of the cleavage fragment hnRNP K (aa.365-464) facilitates viral replication,
      which is similar to full-length hnRNP K, whereas hnRNP K (aa.1-364) inhibits
      viral replication. Additionally, hnRNP K interacts with the viral 5' untranslated
      region (UTR), and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of hnRNP K
      results in significant inhibition of SVV replication. Overall, our results
      demonstrated that the hnRNP K positively regulates SVV replication in a protease 
      activity-dependent fashion in which the cleaved C-terminal contributes crucially 
      to the upregulation of SVV replication. This finding of the role of hnRNP K in
      promoting SVV propagation provides a novel antiviral strategy to utilize hnRNP K 
      as a potential target for therapy.

PG  - 931326
LID - 10.3389/fcell.2022.931326 [doi]
AB  - Loss-of-function mutations in the human potassium chloride cotransporter-3 (KCC3)
      cause a hereditary motor sensory neuropathy associated with agenesis of the
      corpus callosum. While recapitulating the neuropathy, KCC3-knockout mice also
      exhibit high blood pressure. This phenotype is believed to have neurogenic and/or
      vascular origins. The role of KCC3 in the kidney is poorly understood. KCC3 is
      encoded by two major isoforms originating from alternative promoters: KCC3a and
      KCC3b, with KCC3b being the predominant transcript in the kidney. Although the
      transporter has previously been localized to the proximal tubule, we show here
      the unique expression of the KCC3a isoform in the connecting tubule. Using a
      KCC3a-specific polyclonal antibody validated for both immunofluorescence and
      immunoblotting, we showed an intense KCC3a signal restricted to cortical
      intercalated cells. No overlap is detected between KCC3a and sodium chloride
      cotransporter (NCC), a distal convoluted tubule (DCT) marker; or between KCC3a
      and ENaC or calbindin, which are both principal cell markers. KCC3a signal was
      observed in cells expressing the apical V-ATPase and pendrin, establishing a
      unique expression pattern characteristic of intercalated cells of type-B or
      type-nonA/nonB. We further show that treatment of wild-type mice with
      hydrochlorothiazide, amiloride, or fed a K(+)-deficient diet up-regulates KCC3a
      level, suggesting that volume depletion increases KCC3a abundance. This
      hypothesis was confirmed by showing a higher abundance of KCC3a protein after
      23-h water restriction or after placing the mice on a low-salt diet. More
      importantly, abundance of the Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchanger, pendrin, which is known
      to secrete bicarbonate in alkalotic conditions, was significantly diminished in
      KCC3-knockout mice. In addition, KCC3a abundance increased significantly
      alongside pendrin abundance in bicarbonate-treated alkalotic mice, providing a
      credible mechanism for K(+) loss in metabolic alkalosis.

TI  - Deciphering the Role of Alkali Metals (Li, Na, K) Doping for Triggering Nonlinear
      Optical (NLO) Properties of T-Graphene Quantum Dots: Toward the Development of
      Giant NLO Response Materials.
PG  - 24396-24414
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01746 [doi]
AB  - Nanoscale nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have received huge attention of the
      scientists in current decades because of their enormous applications in optics,
      electronics, and telecommunication. Different studies have been conducted to tune
      the nonlinear optical response of the nanomaterials. However, the role of alkali 
      metal (Li, Na, K) doping on triggering the nonlinear optical response of
      nanomaterials by converting their centrosymmetric configuration into
      noncentrosymmetric configuration is rarely studied. Therefore, to find a novel of
      way of making NLO materials, we have employed density functional theory (DFT)
      calculations, which helped us to explore the effect of alkali metal (Li, Na, K)
      doping on the nonlinear optical response of tetragonal graphene quantum dots
      (TGQDs). Ten new complexes of alkali metal doped TGQDs are designed
      theoretically. The binding energy calculations revealed the stability of alkali
      metal doped TGQDs. The NLO responses of newly designed complexes are evaluated by
      their polarizability, first hyperpolarizability (betao), and frequency dependent 
      hyperpolarizabilities. The Li@r8a exhibited the highest first hyperpolarizability
      (betao) value of 5.19 x 10(5) au. All these complexes exhibited complete
      transparency in the UV region. The exceptionally high values of betao of M@TGQDs 
      are accredited to the generation of diffuse excess electrons, as indicated by NBO
      analysis and PDOS. NCI analysis is accomplished to examine the nature of bonding 
      interactions among alkali metal atoms and TGQDs. Our results suggest alkali metal
      doped TGQD complexes as potential candidates for nanoscale NLO materials with
      sufficient stability and enhanced NLO response. This study will open new doors
      for making giant NLO response materials for modern hi-tech applications.

TI  - Rapid synthesis of layered K x MnO2 cathodes from metal-organic frameworks for
      potassium-ion batteries.

AB  - Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are a kind of promising cathode materials
      for potassium-ion batteries because of their abundant raw materials and high
      theoretical capacities. However, their synthesis always involves long time
      calcination at a high temperature, leading to low synthesis efficiency and high
      energy consumption. Herein, an ultra-fast synthesis strategy of Mn-based LTMOs in
      minutes is developed directly from alkali-transition metal based-metal-organic
      frameworks (MOFs). The phase transformation from the MOF to LTMO is
      systematically investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, variable temperature
      optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and the results reveal that the uniform
      distribution of K and Mn ions in MOFs promotes fast phase transformation. As a
      cathode in potassium-ion batteries, the fast-synthesized Mn-based LTMO
      demonstrates an excellent electrochemical performance with 119 mA h g(-1) and
      good cycling stability, highlighting the high production efficiency of LTMOs for 
      future large-scale manufacturing and application of potassium-ion batteries.

TI  - Vitamin K intake and risk of lung cancer: the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study.
LID - 10.2188/jea.JE20220063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited reports from human prospective studies investigated the
      possible role of vitamin K in the development of lung cancer although vitamin K's
      anticarcinogenic activities were verified from several in vitro and in vivo
      studies. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the associations between total vitamin K
      intake from food and the development of lung cancer based on this large
      prospective cohort study. METHODS: A validated food frequency questionnaire was
      used to examine vitamin K intake among 42,166 (16,341 men and 25,825 women) at
      the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study's baseline (1988-1990). Hazard ratios (HRs) 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident lung cancer were calculated using 
      the Cox proportional hazard regression method based on vitamin K consumption
      quartiles. RESULTS: 430 cases (308 males and 122 women) of lung cancer were
      documented during a total of 564,127 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up=
      14.6 years). Vitamin K consumption was shown to be inversely related to lung
      cancer risk; the multivariable HR (95 % CI) for the highest vs. lowest quartiles 
      was 0.67 (0.46-0.96; p for trend = 0.010). This relationship appears to be
      stronger in males [0.62 (0.40-0.96); p for trend=0.016] than in females [0.82
      (0.42-1.61); p for trend=0.39] (p for interaction=0.012), and in ever smokers
      [0.57 (0.36-0.91); p for trend=0.006] than in never smokers [0.79 (0.40-1.55); p 
      for trend=0.37] (p for interaction= 0.30). The individuals' age, BMI, or alcohol 
      consumption status had no effect on the observed connection. CONCLUSION: Vitamin 
      K consumption reduces the risk of lung cancer. More research is needed to clarify
      the molecular processes behind this connection.

TI  - The influence of stereoscopic vision on surgical performance in minimal invasive 
      surgery-a substudy of the IDOSP-Study (Influence of 3D- vs. 4 K-Display Systems
      on Surgical Performance in minimal invasive surgery).
LID - 10.1007/s00423-022-02608-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study is a secondary analysis of the IDOSP trial published in the
      Annals of Surgery 2020. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of
      stereo acuity on surgical performance in a laparoscopic training parkour with 3D-
      versus 4 K-2D-display technique. METHODS: The surgical performance of medical
      students (MS), non-board-certified surgeons (NBC), and board-certified surgeons
      (BC) was compared using 3D- versus 4 K-2D-display technique at a training parkour
      in a randomized cross-over trial. Stereo acuity was tested by TNO and Titmus
      Stereo tests. RESULTS: Eighty-nine participants were included in this sub-trial. 
      The median stereo acuity for all participants, measured with the Titmus test, was
      25 s arc, with TNO test 30 s arc. Higher quality stereo vision, measured with the
      Titmus test, correlated significantly with a reduced parkour time (r = 0.26, p = 
      0.02) and error (r = 0.21, p = 0.048) with the 3D screen. The TNO test did not
      correlate significantly with parkour performance. There was no statistically
      significant correlation between parkour time nor error and stereo acuity using
      the 4 K system (p > 0.457 respectively). Higher age showed a significant
      correlation with lower stereo acuity measured with TNO (r = 0.21, p = 0.014), but
      not with the Titmus test (r = - 0.7, p = 0.39). Seven percent of the group "NBC
      and BC" showed reduced stereo acuity > 120 s arc with the Titmus test and 3% with
      the TNO test. CONCLUSION: High-quality stereo vision is of utmost importance for 
      surgical skills using a 3D-display system. This was most obvious for MS and for
      tasks that place particularly high demands on hand-eye coordination. The Titmus
      test was more precise than the TNO test to predict the benefit of a 3D monitor
      system. Experience and fine motor skills could partly compensate for a poorer
      stereo acuity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at
      clinicaltrials.gov (trial number: NCT03445429, registered February 26, 2018).

AB  - This work analyses the thermostability of a membrane protein, the gastric
      H,K-ATPase, by means of a detailed kinetic characterization of its inactivation
      process, which showed to exhibit first-order kinetics. We observed parallel time 
      courses for the decrease of ATPase activity, the decrease of the
      autophosphorylation capacity and the loss of tertiary structure at 49 degrees C. 
      Higher temperatures were required to induce a significant change in secondary
      structure. The correspondence between the kinetics of Trp fluorescence measured
      at 49 degrees C and the decrease of the residual activity after heating at that
      temperature, proves the irreversibility of the inactivation process. Inactivation
      proceeds at different rates in E1 or E2 conformations. The K(+)-induced E2 state 
      exhibits a lower inactivation rate; the specific effect is exerted with a K0.5
      similar to that found at 25 degrees C, providing a further inkling that K(+)
      occlusion by the H,K-ATPase is not really favoured. Increasing [H(+)] from pH 8
      to pH 7, which possibly shifts the protein to E1, produces a subtle destabilizing
      effect on the H,K-ATPase. We performed a prediction of potential intramolecular
      interactions and found that the differential stability between E1 and E2 may be
      mainly explained by the higher number of hydrophobic interactions in the alpha-
      and beta-subunits of E2 conformation.

TI  - Comparing the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus Vitamin K 
      antagonists in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1097/MBC.0000000000001153 [doi]
AB  - Thromboprophylaxis is the cornerstone strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid
      syndrome (APS). Data comparing direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to Vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in APS patients
      remain contentious. We aim to review and analyse literature on the efficacy and
      safety of DOACs compared with VKAs in treating patients with APS. A literature
      search was performed from inception to 31 December 2021. Subgroups were analysed 
      based on the risk stratification of APS profiles and different DOAC types. A
      total of nine studies with 1131 patients were included in the meta-analysis.
      High-risk APS patients (triple positive APS) who used DOACs displayed an
      increased risk of recurrent thrombosis [risk ratio = 3.65, 95% confidence
      interval (95% CI): 1.49-8.93; I2 = 29%, P = 0.005] compared with those taking
      VKAs. Similar risk of recurrent thrombosis or major bleeding was noted in
      low-risk APS patients (single or double antibody-positive) upon administering
      DOACs or VKAs. The utilization of Rivaroxaban was associated with a high risk of 
      recurrent thromboses (RR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.56-4.42; I2 = 0, P = 0.0003),
      particularly recurrent arterial thromboses (RR = 4.52; 95% CI: 1.99-10.29; I2 =
      0, P = 0.18) in overall APS patients. Comparisons of the rate of recurrent
      thrombosis events and major bleeding events when using dabigatran or apixaban
      versus VKAs yielded no statistical differences. In the absence of
      contraindications, this meta-analysis suggests that VKAs remain the first-choice 
      treatment for high-risk APS patients, with DOACs a more appropriate option for
      low-risk APS patients. Different DOACs may exhibit different levels of efficacy
      and safety for thromboprophylaxis in APS patients and require further
      exploration.

TI  - p53 Binding Sites in Long Terminal Repeat 5Hs (LTR5Hs) of Human Endogenous
      Retrovirus K Family (HML-2 Subgroup) Play Important Roles in the Regulation of
      LTR5Hs Transcriptional Activity.
PG  - e0048522
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00485-22 [doi]
AB  - The long terminal repeats (LTRs) of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are
      distributed throughout the human genome and provide favorable conditions to
      regulate the expression of their adjacent genes. HML-2 is the most biologically
      active subgroup of the HERV-K family, and expression of its members has been
      associated with many cancer types. The LTRs of HML-2 have been classified into
      three subgroups (LTR5A, LTR5B, and LTR5Hs) based on phylogenetic analyses. The
      current study aimed to explore the LTR transcriptional activity differences among
      the three subtypes and further explore the underlying factors. A total of 43
      LTR5A elements, 62 LTR5B elements, and 194 LTR5Hs elements were selected. A
      phylogenetic tree showed that the LTR5Hs group was clearly separated from the
      LTR5A and LTR5B groups. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that LTR5Hs had the
      strongest promoter activity, followed by LTR5A and LTR5B. To investigate the
      underlying factors, LTR5Hs was divided into 4 sections, and the homologous
      fragments in LTR5B were replaced successively. Replacement of the third section
      (-263 to 0) significantly increased LTR5B activity. Subsequent mutation
      experiments revealed that the increased transcriptional activity was induced by
      the TATA box and the two p53 binding sites within the section. Further
      interference with TP53 significantly decreased LTR5Hs transcriptional activity.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and CUT&Tag experiments finally confirmed
      the direct binding of the p53 protein with the two LTR5Hs p53 binding sites.
      Overall, the two p53 binding sites in the third section (-263 to 0) of LTR5Hs
      were revealed to play critical roles in the difference in transcriptional
      activity among the three subtypes. IMPORTANCE Human endogenous retroviruses
      (HERVs) were integrated into the human genome in ancient times and have been
      coevolving with the host. Since the Human Genome Project, HERVs have attracted
      increasing attention. Many studies have focused on their characterization,
      evolution, and biological function. In particular, the expression of HERV-K has
      been associated with many diseases, such as germ cell tumors, neurotoxicity,
      ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Indeed, two HML-2-produced
      proteins, Np9 and Rec, are associated with certain cancers. However, their roles 
      in these disease associations remain unclear. The current work focused on
      subgroup HML-2 of HERV-K, which is recognized as the most biologically active
      subgroup, and aimed to explore the mechanistic basis of transcriptional activity.
      The results revealed that p53 deeply determined the activity of HML-2 LTR5Hs. p53
      is a rather important tumor suppressor protein. It can regulate the expression of
      genes related to cell cycle arrest, organic processes, and apoptosis in response 
      to cellular stress and is critical for the control of homeostasis. Previous ChIP 
      and expression studies of individual genes suggested that p53 sites in HERV LTRs 
      may be part of the p53 transcription program and directly regulate p53 target
      genes in a species-specific manner. However, the exact function of p53 in the
      regulation of HERV LTR expression is largely elusive. Our results clearly
      demonstrated the interaction between LTR5Hs of HML-2 and p53. They are of great
      significance for the future comprehensive study of the physiological and
      pathological functions of LTRs of HERVs.

AB  - Adding protein-bound polysaccharide K (PSK) to adjuvant chemotherapy with
      mitomycin and fluorouracil after gastrectomy for gastric cancer was demonstrated 
      to improve survival in a previous study in Japan. However, the efficacy of PSK
      outside Japan and in combination with other adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents
      remains unclear. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of PSK. We 
      conducted a population-based historical cohort study using the National Health
      Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We performed sensitivity analysis with
      propensity score matching to control for possible confounders. Patients who used 
      PSK (PSK group) were matched at a 1:4 ratio to those who had never used PSK
      (control group) after adjusting for covariates including sex, age, urbanization, 
      income and comorbidities. The primary outcome was overall survival. Multivariate 
      hazard ratios from competing risk analysis were calculated by adjusting for
      demographic data and all confounding factors. From 1999 to 2008, we identified
      10,617 patients with gastric cancer received gastrectomy and adjuvant
      chemotherapy. 1295 patients used PSK (PSK group) and 5180 patients never used PSK
      (control group) were analyzed after propensity score matching. The median overall
      survival was 6.49 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.22-7.63) in the PSK group
      and 3.59 years (95% CI 3.38-3.80) in the control group. After adjusting for age, 
      sex, urbanization, income, and comorbidities, adding PSK to adjuvant chemotherapy
      was the most significant prognostic factor for improved survival (hazard ratio
      0.76, P < .0001). Adjuvant chemotherapy combined with PSK significantly prolonged
      overall survival in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.

TI  - HnRNP K regulates inflammatory gene expression by mediating splicing pattern of
      transcriptional factors.
PG  - 15353702221110649
LID - 10.1177/15353702221110649 [doi]
AB  - HnRNP K is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and has been identified as
      an oncogene in most solid tumors via regulating gene expression or alternative
      splicing of genes by binding both DNA and pre-mRNA. However, how hnRNP K affects 
      tumorigenesis and regulates the gene expression in cervical cancer (CESC) remains
      to be elucidated. In these data, higher expression of hnRNP K was observed in
      CESC and was negatively correlated with the patient survival time. We then
      overexpressed hnRNP K (hnRNP K-OE) and found that its overexpression promoted
      cell proliferation in HeLa cells (P = 0.0052). Next, global transcriptome
      sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments were conducted to explore gene expression and
      alternative splicing profiles regulated by hnRNP K. It is shown that upregulated 
      genes by hnRNP K-OE were associated with inflammatory response and an apoptotic
      process of neuron cells, which involves in cancer. In addition, the alternative
      splicing of those genes regulated by hnRNP K-OE was associated with
      transcriptional regulation. Analysis of the binding features of dysregulated
      transcription factors (TFs) in the promoter region of the inflammatory response
      genes regulated by hnRNP K revealed that hnRNP K may modulate the expression
      level of genes related to inflammatory response by influencing the alternative
      splicing of TFs. Among these hnRNP K-TFs-inflammatory gene regulatory networks,
      quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
      experiments and gene silencing were conducted to verify the hnRNP K-IRF1-CCL5
      axis. In conclusion, the hnRNP K-TFs-inflammatory gene regulatory axis provides a
      novel molecular mechanism for hnRNP K in promoting CESC and offers a new
      therapeutic target.

PG  - e2021JD035343
LID - 10.1029/2021JD035343 [doi]
AB  - Atomic oxygen (O) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) results from a
      balance between production via photo-dissociation in the lower thermosphere and
      chemical loss by recombination in the upper mesosphere. The transport of O
      downward from the lower thermosphere into the mesosphere is preferentially driven
      by the eddy diffusion process that results from dissipating gravity waves and
      instabilities. The motivation here is to probe the intra-annual variability of
      the eddy diffusion coefficient (k zz ) and eddy velocity in the MLT based on the 
      climatology of the region, initially accomplished by Garcia and Solomon (1985,
      https://doi.org/10.1029/JD090iD02p03850). In the current study, the intra-annual 
      cycle was divided into 26 two-week periods for each of three zones: the northern 
      hemisphere (NH), southern hemisphere (SH), and equatorial (EQ). Both 16 years of 
      SABER (2002-2018) and 10 years of SCIAMACHY (2002-2012) O density measurements,
      along with NRLMSIS((R)) 2.0 were used for calculation of atomic oxygen eddy
      diffusion velocities and fluxes. Our prominent findings include a dominant annual
      oscillation below 87 km in the NH and SH zones, with a factor of 3-4 variation
      between winter and summer at 83 km, and a dominant semiannual oscillation at all 
      altitudes in the EQ zone. The measured global average k zz at 96 km lacks the
      intra-annual variability of upper atmosphere density data deduced by Qian et al. 
      (2009, https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JA013643). The very large seasonal (and
      hemispherical) variations in k zz and O densities are important to separate and
      isolate in satellite analysis and to incorporate in MLT models.

      Warfarin or Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 874460
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.874460 [doi]
AB  - Background: Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is a risk factor for ischemic bowel
      disease, data regarding the incidence of ischemic bowel disease in patients with 
      anticoagulated AF were limited. Methods: The present study used the Taiwan NHIRD 
      and included newly diagnosed patients with AF aged >/= 20 years without ischemic 
      bowel disease from 2012 to 2018. A total of 69,549 patients taking warfarin or
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) constituted the final study 
      group. We aimed to study the incidence of ischemic bowel disease in patients with
      AF receiving warfarin or NOACs. Secondary endpoints were also analyzed, including
      ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, mortality,
      intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major bleeding, and composite adverse events
      (ischemic bowel disease or ICH or major bleeding). Results: There were 43,787
      patients taking NOACs and 25,762 patients taking warfarin. The overall incidence 
      rate of ischemic bowel disease was 0.036% per year and increased with the
      CHA2DS2-VASc scores [0.013% for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 (men) or 
      1 (women), 0.022% for those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women),
      and 0.039% for those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score >/= 2 (men) or >/= 3 (women)]. The
      risk of ischemic bowel disease was similar between NOAC and warfarin groups
      (0.036%/year vs. 0.037%/year; adjusted hazard ratio 0.802, p = 0.430), whereas
      the NOAC group had a significantly lower risk of secondary endpoints compared to 
      the warfarin group. Conclusion: We reported the incidence of ischemic bowel
      disease in patients with anticoagulated AF from a nationwide cohort database and 
      observed a positive correlation between the increase of CHA2DS2-VASc scores and
      the incidence rate. Moreover, NOAC was as effective as warfarin for the risk of
      ischemic bowel disease.

LID - 10.1038/s41589-022-01065-9 [doi]
AB  - Drugs that directly impede the function of driver oncogenes offer exceptional
      efficacy and a therapeutic window. The recently approved mutant selective
      small-molecule cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitor of the G12C mutant of K-Ras, 
      sotorasib, provides a case in point. KRAS is the most frequently mutated
      proto-oncogene in human cancer, yet despite success targeting the G12C allele,
      targeted therapy for other hotspot mutants of KRAS has not been described. Here
      we report the discovery of small molecules that covalently target a G12S somatic 
      mutation in K-Ras and suppress its oncogenic signaling. We show that these
      molecules are active in cells expressing K-Ras(G12S) but spare the wild-type
      protein. Our results provide a path to targeting a second somatic mutation in the
      oncogene KRAS by overcoming the weak nucleophilicity of an acquired serine
      residue. The chemistry we describe may serve as a basis for the selective
      targeting of other unactivated serines.

TI  - Afterhyperpolarization Potential Modulated by Local [K(+)]o in K(+)
      Diffusion-Restricted Extracellular Space in the Central Clock of Suprachiasmatic 
      Nucleus.
LID - S2319-4170(22)00105-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bj.2022.07.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intercellular coupling is essential for the suprachiasmatic nucleus
      (SCN) to serve as a coherent central clock. Synaptic release of neurotransmitters
      and neuropeptides is critical for synchronizing SCN neurons. However,
      intercellular coupling via non-synaptic mechanisms has also been demonstrated. In
      particular, the abundant perikaryal appositions with morphological
      specializations in the narrow extracellular space (ECS) may hinder molecular
      diffusion to allow for ion accumulation or depletion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      SCN neurons were recorded in the whole-cell current-clamp mode, with pipette
      filled with high (26 mM)-Na(+) or low (6 mM)-Na(+) solution. RESULTS: Cells
      recorded with high-Na(+) pipette solution could fire spontaneous action
      potentials (AP) with peak AHP more negative than the calculated value of K(+)
      equilibrium potential (EK) and with peak AP more positive than calculated ENa.
      Cells recorded with low-Na(+) pipette solution could also have peak AHP more
      negative than calculated EK. In contrast, the resting membrane potential (RMP)
      was always less negative to calculated EK. The distribution and the averaged
      amplitude of peak AHP, peak AP, or RMP was similar between cells recorded with
      high-Na(+) and low-Na(+) solution pipette. In a number of cells, the peak AHP
      could increase from more positive to become more negative than calculated EK
      spontaneously or after treatments to hyperpolarize the RMP. TTX blocked the
      Na(+)-dependent action potentials and tetraethylammonium (TEA), but not Ba(2+) or
      Cd(2+), markedly reduced the peak AHP. Perforated-patch cells could also but
      rarely fire action potentials with peak AHP more negative than calculated EK.
      CONCLUSIONS: The result of peak AHP negative to calculated EK indicates that
      local [K(+)]o sensed by the TEA-sensitive AHP K(+) channels must be lower than
      bulk [K(+)]o, most likely due to K(+) clearance from K(+) diffusion-restricted
      ECS by the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. The K(+) diffusion-restricted ECS may allow for
      K(+)-mediated ionic interactions among neurons to regulate SCN excitability.

TI  - Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 Schools, British 
      Columbia, Canada April to June 2021.
PG  - e0062222
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00622-22 [doi]
AB  - We prospectively studied SARS-CoV-2 transmission at schools in an era of variants
      of concern, offering all close contacts serial viral asymptomatic testing up to
      14 days. From the 69 primary cases detected in schools, 392 close contacts were
      identified and offered asymptomatic testing. A total of 229 (58%) were close
      school contacts, and of these, 3 tested positive (1.3%), 2 of which were detected
      through asymptomatic testing. This is in contrast to the 117 household contacts, 
      where 43 (37%) went on to become secondary cases. Routine asymptomatic testing of
      close contacts should be examined in the context of local testing rates,
      preventive measures, programmatic costs, and health impacts of asymptomatic
      transmission. IMPORTANCE There is concern that schools may be a setting where
      asymptomatic infections might result in significant "silent" transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2, particularly after the emergence of more transmissible variants of
      concern. After the programmatic implementation of a strategy of asymptomatic
      testing of close COVID-19 contacts as part of contact tracing in the school
      setting, the majority of the secondary cases were still found to have occurred in
      home or social contacts. However, for the 6.2% of secondary cases that occurred
      in close school contacts, the majority were detected through asymptomatic
      testing. The potential added yield of this approach needs to be considered within
      the overall setting, including consideration of the local epidemiology, ongoing
      goals of case and contact management, additional costs, logistical challenges for
      families, and possible health impacts of asymptomatic transmission.

TI  - Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks Associated with Liquid Na-K toward
      Dendrite-Free Alkali Metal Anodes.
PG  - e2203058
LID - 10.1002/advs.202203058 [doi]
AB  - Liquid sodium-potassium (Na-K) alloy has the characteristics of high abundance,
      low redox potential, high capacity, and no dendrites, which has become an ideal
      alternative material for potassium/sodium metal anodes. However, the high surface
      tension of liquid sodium potassium alloy at room temperature makes it
      inconvenient in practical use. Here, the Na-K as reducing agent treats with
      hydrazone linkages of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and obtain the
      carbon-oxygen radical COFs (COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs). The preparation method solves the
      problems that the preparation process of the traditional Na-K composite anode is 
      complex and has high cost. The structures of the COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs are
      characterized by X-ray diffraction XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),
      electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and solid-state NMR measurements. It is
      the first time that carbon-oxygen radical COFs from bulk COFs are constructed by 
      one-step method and the operation is flexible, convenient, and high rate of
      quality, which is suitable for big production and widely used. The cycle
      stability of the composite Na-K anode is improved, which provides a new idea for 
      the design of high-performance liquid metal anode.

TI  - The Role of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) in Atrial
      Fibrillation: Treatment Management Based on Patient and Drug Characteristics.
PG  - 356-370
LID - 10.5543/tkda.2022.21191 [doi]
AB  - Data from Turkey revealed that atrial fibrillation patient percentage under
      adequate anti- coagulation in Turkey is less than that in other countries due to 
      multiple parameters such as treatment adherence problems, failure to follow
      guideline recommendations, negative perspective on the use of new drugs, drug
      costs, and payment conditions. The aim of this article is to provide physicians
      with a compiled resource that focuses on the differences between non-vitamin K
      antagonist oral anticoagulants and heterogeneity of atrial fibrilla- tion
      patients by reviewing the global and national data from a multidisciplinary
      perspective and provide guidance on the choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation patients. A gastroenterologist, 2
      neurologists, and 11 cardiologists from university and training and research
      hospitals in Turkey who are experienced in atrial fibrillation and non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulant treatments gathered in 3 separate meetings to
      identify the review topics and evaluate the outcomes of the systematic literature
      search. Based on the pharmacological characteristics, clinical studies, and
      real-world data compari- sons, it has been revealed that non-vitamin K antagonist
      oral anticoagulants are not similar. Thromboembolism and bleeding risks, renal
      and hepatic functions, coexisting conditions, and concomitant drug usage have
      been shown to affect the levels of benefits gained from non-vitamin K antagonist 
      oral anticoagulant in atrial fibrillation patients. Although Turkish patients
      with atrial fibrillation have been observed to be younger, they are more likely
      to have coexisting cardiovascular conditions compared to the atrial fibrillation 
      patients in other countries. Selection of an appropriate non-vitamin K antagonist
      oral anticoagulant in line with the available evidence and recent guidelines will
      provide substantial benefits to atrial fibrillation patients.

      1.5mm K-wires; case report and technical note.
PG  - 103906
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103906 [doi]
AB  - Introduction and importance: Here we represented a new technique of closed
      reduction and transverse pinning to address first metatarsal comminuted fractures
      in patients with a concomitant second metatarsal shaft fracture. Case
      presentation: The first metatarsal comminuted fracture coincides with the second 
      metatarsal simple fracture in this forefoot injury case. In a new technique, we
      used close reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) in a transverse direction of
      pins to achieve a satisfactory outcome.After performing traditional CRPP to fix
      the second metatarsal fracture, it served as physical support for the first
      metatarsal fixation. We drilled two 1.5mm pins through the first metatarsal bone 
      at each proximal and distal side of the fracture site, transversely passed to the
      second metatarsal bone. Transverse pins came along from the first metatarsal
      medial side to the lateral. After six-week and 12-month follow-up, the patients
      had minimal pain with complete radiological and clinical fracture healing and no 
      complication. Clinical discussion: Here, internal fixation was unsuitable due to 
      extensive soft-tissue injury and inadequate bone support. Despite the many
      advantages of external fixators, they have drawbacks that persuade us to perform 
      our new technique: using K-wires for transverse pinning fixation of the first
      metatarsal fracture using an adjacent metatarsal as support. This minimally
      invasive approach is profitable because of its minimal soft tissue damage,
      affordable price, and convenient access. Conclusion: The transfixation technique 
      with K-wires is rarely used to treat metatarsal fractures. It may be helpful in
      similar cases of comminuted first metatarsal fracture with satisfactory outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of two types of stressors,
      regarding the extent of involvement of ouabain (OUA), hippocampal
      sodium/potassium ATPase (NKA) expression, and the hippocampal corticosterone
      receptors (CR)/melatonin receptors (MR) expression ratio, on the behavioral and
      cardiovascular responses and on the hippocampal cornu ammonis zone 3 (CA3) and
      dentate gyrus (DG). Thirty adult male Wistar albino rats aged 7-8 months were
      exposed to either chronic immobilization or a disturbed dark/light cycle and
      treated with either ouabain or vehicle. In the immobilized group, in the absence 
      of hippocampal corticosterone (CORT) changes, rats were non-responsive to stress,
      despite experiencing increased pulse rate, downregulated hippocampal
      sodium/potassium pump, and enhanced hippocampal CR/MR expression ratio. Prolonged
      darkness precipitated a reduced upright attack posture, with elevated CORT
      against hippocampal MR downregulation. Both immobilization and, to a lesser
      extent, prolonged darkness stress resulted in histopathological and
      ultrastructural neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus. OUA administration 
      did not change the behavioral resilience in restrained rats, despite persistence 
      of the underlying biochemical derangements, added to decreased CORT. On the
      contrary, with exposure to short photoperiods, OUA reverted the behavior towards 
      a combative reduction of inactivity, with unvaried CR/MR and CORT, while
      ameliorating hippocampal neuro-regeneration, with co-existing NKA and MR
      repressions. Therefore, the extent of OUA, hippocampal NKA expression, and CR/MR 
      expression, and subsequent behavioral and cardiac responses and hippocampal
      histopathology, differ according to the type of stressor, whether immobilization 
      or prolonged darkness.

TI  - Cathepsin K Mutation-A Subtle Clinical Presentation.
PG  - bvac102
LID - 10.1210/jendso/bvac102 [doi]
AB  - Context: Pyknodysostosis is an uncommon inherited disorder associated with
      consanguinity, often presenting with sclerotic bone disease, short stature,
      dysmorphic features, and recurrent fragility fractures at an early age. Case: A
      34-year-old woman was evaluated for the cause of recurrent fragility fractures.
      She was born of a third-degree consanguineous marriage and had a twin brother who
      was of short stature. The index patient had a height of 141 cm, dysmorphic
      features including frontoparietal bossing, blue sclera with short stubby fingers 
      and toes. Radiological evaluation revealed diffuse osteosclerosis with
      acro-osteolysis exclusively in the toes, apart from mid-facial hypoplasia, lack
      of pneumatization of the paranasal sinuses, dental abnormalities, and scoliosis. 
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed increased bone mineral density. Based
      on the clinical features, the patient was tested for cathepsin K gene variants
      using next-generation sequencing and was found to be positive for a novel
      homozygous c.224T>C, p.Met75Thr likely pathogenic missense variant. Discussion:
      This patient presented at a later age than expected with recurrent fragility
      fractures and the diagnosis was not suspected till adulthood, owing to the subtle
      clinical features. Confirmation with genetic testing helped in establishing the
      diagnosis. Conclusion: Pyknodysostosis, although uncommon, is one of the
      differential diagnoses for diffuse osteosclerosis presenting with recurrent
      fragility fractures. Next-generation sequencing in an appropriate setting may
      confirm the diagnosis.

LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.105.064116 [doi]
AB  - We study the explosive percolation with k-mer random sequential adsorption (RSA) 
      process. We consider both the Achlioptas process (AP) and the inverse Achlioptas 
      process (IAP), in which giant cluster formation is prohibited and accelerated,
      respectively. By employing finite-size scaling analysis, we confirm that the
      percolation transitions are continuous, and thus we calculate the percolation
      threshold and critical exponents. This allows us to determine the universality
      class of the k-mer explosive percolation transition. Interestingly, the numerical
      simulation suggests that the universality class of the explosive percolation
      transition with the AP alters when the k-mer size changes. In contrast, the
      universality class of the transition with the IAP is independent of k, but it
      differs from that of the RSA without the IAP.

TI  - Different standing postures are the influencing factors for the efficacy of
      laminoplasty in the treatment of K-Line (-) patients with ossification of the
      posterior longitudinal ligament.
LID - 10.1007/s00586-022-07300-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between different standing postures
      and surgical outcomes of K-Line (-) ossification of the posterior longitudinal
      ligament (OPLL) patients after laminoplasty with a titanium basket. There is a
      lack of data evaluating the relationship between the postoperative satisfaction
      of K-Line (-) patients and their standing postures. METHODS: OPLL patients
      enrolled in the study were divided into a K-Line (+) group (Group A) and a K-Line
      (- group (Group B) in natural and relaxed standing positions. We compared the
      postoperative outcomes after cervical laminoplasty with titanium basket surgery
      using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA), recovery rate and the
      degree of improvement in the six JOA score items. The degree of satisfaction with
      the outcome was assessed at the 1-year follow-up using a 7-point numerical rating
      scale. RESULTS: A total of 34 K-Line (+) patients with OPLL (age 61.9 +/- 2.9
      years) in Group A and 40 K-Line (-)patients with OPLL (age 60.4 +/- 3.5 years) in
      Group B in natural and relaxed standing positions were recruited. In Group A, the
      mean preoperative and postoperative JOA scores were 10.1 +/- 1.4 and 13.1 +/- 0.8
      points, respectively, and in Group B, the mean preoperative and postoperative JOA
      scores were 9.7 +/- 1.3 and 11.1 +/- 0.9 points, respectively. A significant
      improvement in the JOA score was seen in both groups postoperatively, but the
      recovery rate of the patients' JOA scores was significantly lower in Group B. In 
      Group A, significant improvements were seen in all JOA score items, but in Group 
      B, improvements were seen only in upper- and lower-extremity sensory functions.
      CONCLUSION: Different standing postures are risk factors in the treatment of
      K-Line (-) patients, and therefore, natural and relaxed standing positions should
      be given more attention before devising the surgical plan.

TI  - Use of Multiple Correspondence Analysis and K-means to Explore Associations
      Between Risk Factors and Likelihood of Colorectal Cancer: Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e29056
LID - 10.2196/29056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous works have shown that risk factors are associated with an
      increased likelihood of colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study
      was to detect these associations in the region of Lleida (Catalonia) by using
      multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and k-means. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study was made up of 1083 colorectal cancer episodes between 2012 and 2015,
      extracted from the population-based cancer registry for the province of Lleida
      (Spain), the Primary Care Centers database, and the Catalan Health Service
      Register. The data set included risk factors such as smoking and BMI as well as
      sociodemographic information and tumor details. The relations between the risk
      factors and patient characteristics were identified using MCA and k-means.
      RESULTS: The combination of these techniques helps to detect clusters of patients
      with similar risk factors. Risk of death is associated with being elderly and
      obesity or being overweight. Stage III cancer is associated with people aged
      >/=65 years and rural/semiurban populations, while younger people were associated
      with stage 0. CONCLUSIONS: MCA and k-means were significantly useful for
      detecting associations between risk factors and patient characteristics. These
      techniques have proven to be effective tools for analyzing the incidence of some 
      factors in colorectal cancer. The outcomes obtained help corroborate suspected
      trends and stimulate the use of these techniques for finding the association of
      risk factors with the incidence of other cancers.

TI  - Valsa mali secretes an effector protein VmEP1 to target a K homology
      domain-containing protein for virulence in apple.
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13248 [doi]
AB  - The K homology (KH) repeat is an RNA-binding motif that exists in various
      proteins, some of which participate in plant growth. However, the function of KH 
      domain-containing proteins in plant defence is still unclear. In this study, we
      found that a KH domain-containing protein in apple (Malus domestica), HEN4-like
      (MdKRBP4), is involved in the plant immune response. Silencing of MdKRBP4
      compromised reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced the
      susceptibility of apple to Valsa mali, whereas transient overexpression of
      MdKRBP4 stimulated ROS accumulation in apple leaves, indicating that MdKRBP4 is a
      positive immune regulator. Additionally, MdKRBP4 was proven to interact with the 
      VmEP1 effector secreted by V. mali, which led to decreased accumulation of
      MdKRBP4. Coexpression of MdKRBP4 with VmEP1 inhibited cell death and ROS
      production induced by MdKRBP4 in Nicotiana benthamiana. These results indicate
      that MdKRBP4 functions as a novel positive regulatory factor in plant immunity in
      M. domestica and is a virulence target of the V. mali effector VmEP1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are the most widely used anticoagulants
      for the prevention of thrombotic events. Several renal adverse effects have been 
      associated with the use of VKA. The main aim of our study was to explore the
      association between international normalized ratio (INR) levels and microscopic
      hematuria in patients with VKA. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 
      patients treated with VKA that attended the outpatient clinic for routine INR
      control. A simple urinalysis was performed on the day of the INR control and the 
      precise number of red cells in the urine sediment was quantified. Demographic
      data, kidney function tests, comorbidities, anticoagulant dose and concomitant
      treatment were registered. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were included with
      median INR levels of 2.6 (IQR 2.1-3.3). 11.9% of the patients presented
      microscopic hematuria (>/=14 RBCs/microl). There was a significant correlation
      between INR levels and the number of red blood cells in the urine sediment (r=
      0.201, p= 0.024). In the univariate analysis, microscopic hematuria was
      associated with having an INR >3.5 (19% vs. 10.2%, p=0.046), bacteriuria (15.2%
      vs. 3.6%, p=0.015), leukocyturia (14.8% vs. 6.6%, p= 0.026), hypertension (16.2% 
      vs. 9.5%, p=0.053), and the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (6.9% 
      vs. 17.2%, p=0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed an association
      between microscopic hematuria and RAS blockade (OR 0.38, CI 95% 0.163-0.886,
      p=0.025), independent from INR levels, hypertension, leukocyturia or bacteriuria.
      CONCLUSIONS: INR overdose was significantly associated with the presence of
      microscopic hematuria. RAS blockade is an independent protective factor for the
      presence of microscopic hematuria in anticoagulated patients.

TI  - The erythroid K-Cl cotransport inhibitor [(Dihydroindenyl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA) 
      blocks erythroid Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel KCNN4.
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00240.2022 [doi]
AB  - Red cell volume is a major determinant of HbS concentration in sickle cell
      disease. Cellular deoxy-HbS concentration determines the delay time, the interval
      between HbS deoxygenation and deoxy-HbS polymerization. Major membrane
      transporter protein determinants of sickle red cell volume include the SLC12/KCC 
      K-Cl cotransporters KCC3/SLC12A6 and KCC1/SLC12A4, and the KCNN4/KCa3.1
      Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (Gardos channel). Among standard inhibitors of
      KCC-mediated K-Cl cotransport, only [(dihydroindenyl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA) has
      been reported to lack inhibitory activity against the related
      bumetanide-sensitive erythroid Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1/SLC12A2. DIOA has
      been often used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport when studying expression and
      regulation of other K(+) transporters and K(+) channels. We report here that DIOA
      at concentrations routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also abrogate
      activity of the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Gardos channel in human and mouse red cells and in
      human sickle red cells. DIOA inhibition of A23187-stimulated erythroid K(+)
      uptake (Gardos channel activity) was chloride-independent and persisted in mouse 
      red cells genetically devoid of the principal K-Cl cotransporters KCC3 and KCC1. 
      DIOA also inhibited YODA1-stimulated, chloride-independent erythroid K(+) uptake.
      In contrast, DIOA exhibited no inhibitory effect on K(+) influx into
      A23187-treated red cells of Kcnn4(-/-) mice. DOIA inhibition of human KCa3.1 was 
      validated (IC50 42 microM) by whole cell patch clamp in HEK-293 cells.
      RosettaLigand docking experiments identified a potential binding site for DIOA in
      the fenestration region of human KCa3.1. We conclude that DIOA at concentrations 
      routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also block the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Gardos
      channel in normal and sickle red cells.

AB  - A single-cell sequencing data set has always been a challenge for clustering
      because of its high dimension and multi-noise points. The traditional K-means
      algorithm is not suitable for this type of data. Therefore, this study proposes a
      Dissimilarity-Density-Dynamic Radius-K-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm 
      adds the dynamic radius parameter to the calculation. It flexibly adjusts the
      active radius according to the data characteristics, which can eliminate the
      influence of noise points and optimize the clustering results. At the same time, 
      the algorithm calculates the weight through the dissimilarity density of the data
      set, the average contrast of candidate clusters, and the dissimilarity of
      candidate clusters. It obtains a set of high-quality initial center points, which
      solves the randomness of the K-means algorithm in selecting the center points.
      Finally, compared with similar algorithms, this algorithm shows a better
      clustering effect on single-cell data. Each clustering index is higher than other
      single-cell clustering algorithms, which overcomes the shortcomings of the
      traditional K-means algorithm.

TI  - Comparing direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonist use in morbidly
      obese patients with venous thromboembolism: A single center retrospective cohort 
      study.
PG  - 457-462
LID - 10.1002/jha2.418 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Limited data exists on the safety and efficacy of direct-acting
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC) use in morbidly obese patients with venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). Given the benefits of DOAC use over vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs), in terms of monitoring requirements, and dietary and drug interactions,
      it is important to evaluate whether this is consistent in the higher risk for VTE
      recurrence morbidly obese group body mass index (BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2)). Materials
      and methods: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included patients
      with a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) who were admitted to Emory University Hospital 
      from 1(st) January 2012 to 31(st) May 2020 with acute VTE, and subsequently
      initiated on anticoagulation treatment with either DOAC or VKA (warfarin).
      Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to evaluate differences in
      demographics by treatment type and BMI. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard
      regression was used to assess the risk of VTE recurrence by type of treatment
      among morbidly obese patient subgroup. Results: There were 247 (11.8%) morbidly
      obese (>/= 40 kg/m(2)) patients who were more likely than non-obese patients to
      be younger, female, and of non-white race. Thirty percent of the study population
      (n=74) had a BMI >50 kg/m(2). T ime-to-event analysis confirmed that the hazard
      of experiencing a recurrent thrombosis was not statistically significantly
      different among morbidly obese patients treated with a DOAC compared with VKA
      (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.28, confidence interval [CI] 0.07-1.11, p = 0.07).
      Conclusions: This study aligns with previous literature and confirms that
      morbidly obese patients receiving DOAC or VKA have similar risks of recurrent
      VTE.

LID - 10.1155/2022/9222958 [doi]
AB  - Due to the fact that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is still a relatively slow 
      imaging modality, its application for dynamic imaging is restricted. The total
      variation is introduced into the CS-based MRI reconstruction model, and three
      regularization conditions are adopted to ensure that a high-quality reconstructed
      image is produced. In this paper, a simple yet fast CS-based optimization model
      for noisy MRI Enhancement is proposed. The alternative direction multiplier
      method is chosen to optimize the model, and the k-terms power series is applied
      in order to derive the LogDet function into the augmented Lagrange form.
      Following this, an approximation of the feature vector is achieved through the
      iterative process. The quality of the reconstructed image was much better than
      that of the CS-based MRI image reconstruction algorithm, as shown by experimental
      results under different noise conditions. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the
      reconstructed image was able to be improved anywhere from 5 to 20 percent.

AB  - Curcumin (CUR) is a natural bioactive compound that has attracted attention as a 
      "golden molecule" due to its therapeutic properties against several types of
      tumors. Nonetheless, the antitumor application of CUR is hampered due to its
      extremely low aqueous solubility and chemical instability. Herein, a novel type
      of CUR-loaded polymeric micelles with intracellular K(+)-responsive
      controlled-release properties is designed and developed. The polymeric micelles
      are self-assembled by poly
      (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acryloylamidobenzo-15-crown-5-co-N,
      N-dimethylacrylamide)-b-DSPE (PNDB-b-DSPE) block copolymers, and CUR. CUR is
      successfully loaded into the micelles with a CUR loading content of 6.26 wt%. The
      proposed CUR-PNDB-DSPE polymeric micelles exhibit a significant CUR release in
      simulated intracellular fluid due to the formation of 2 : 1 ''sandwich''
      host-guest complexes of 15-crown-5 and K(+), which lead to the hydrophilic outer 
      shell of micelles to collapse and the drug to rapidly migrate out of the
      micelles. In vitro, the B16F10 cell experiment indicates that CUR-PNDB-DSPE
      micelles exhibit a high cellular uptake and excellent intracellular drug release 
      in response to the intracellular K(+) concentration. Moreover, CUR-PNDB-DSPE
      micelles show high cytotoxicity to B16F10 cells compared to free CUR and
      CUR-PEG-DSPE micelles. The polymeric micelles with intracellular K(+)-responsive 
      controlled release properties proposed in this study provide a new strategy for
      designing novel targeted drug delivery systems for CUR delivery for cancer
      treatment.

AB  - Changes in pulmonary microhemodynamics in response to pulmonary embolism under
      conditions of activation of KATP channels with nicorandil, Kv channels with
      dapagliflozin, and BKCa channels with Evans blue were studied on isolated rabbit 
      lungs. Under conditions of activation of KATP and BKCa channels, the constrictor 
      reactions of the pulmonary arterial vessels during embolization of the pulmonary 
      artery were less pronounced than in the control. Activation of BKCa channels
      reduced constrictor reactions of the pulmonary venous vessels, while activation
      of KATP and Kv channels eliminates them. The shifts of the capillary filtration
      coefficient are determined to a greater extent by the pre-/postcapillary
      resistance ratio, than by changes of the endothelial permeability. Pretreatment
      with dapagliflozin led to a decrease in the capillary filtration coefficient. It 
      was established, that nimesulide exhibits properties of a BKCa-channel activator.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a sustainable alternative callus culture
      of Cereus hildmannianus for the production and bioactive determination of
      phenolic compounds from this species. The conventional callus was cultivated
      using agar and Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, while for the alternative culture
      the agar was replaced with a cotton support covered with filter paper and MS
      medium (incubated at 32 degrees C with photoperiod of 16 h), and the
      morphological characteristics and growth index were assessed (8 weeks). Extracts 
      were obtained by maceration followed by partition, characterized by nuclear
      magnetic resonance - NMR and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography -
      UHPLC, quantified (phenolic compounds) by UV-Vis methods, and their antioxidant, 
      antitumor activities, as well as cytotoxicity, were evaluated. The establishment 
      of an alternative callus culture was carried out successfully. Characteristic
      signals of phenolic compounds were determined by NMR, and 46 compounds with
      fragment ions were identified using UHPLC analysis. The highest concentrations of
      phenolic compounds, and greatest antioxidant and antitumor activities, were
      obtained with the dichloromethane fractions of both callus tissue cultures, which
      were not cytotoxic. The callus culture from C. hildmannianus has shown promise as
      a source for the sustainable production of phenolic compounds with antioxidant
      and antiproliferative activities and thus, has potential use as a natural
      antitumor product.

TI  - The decrease of selenoprotein K induced by selenium deficiency in diet improves
      apoptosis and cell progression block in chicken liver via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT
      pathway.

AB  - Selenoprotein K (SELK) is imperative for normal development of chicken. It does
      regulate to chicken's physiological function. However, the injury of
      SELK-deficiency done on chicken liver and its underlying mechanism involved has
      not yet been covered. Therefore, we built SELK- deficiency model by feeding diet 
      which contained low concentration of selenium (Se) to discuss SELK's regulation
      mechanism. Through using TUNEL, TEM, western blot and qRT-PCR we found apoptosis 
      occurred in chicken liver in the SELK-deficiency groups. In the meanwhile, our
      study showed there were differentially expressed of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway,
      calcium homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum healthy and cell cycle progression in 
      SELK-deficiency chicken liver tissues. In order to claim the regulation mechanism
      of SELK, we set SELK-knock down model in the LMH. The results in vitro were
      coincided with those in vivo. In the SELK-deficiency groups, the PTEN/PI3K/AKT
      pathway was activated and then induced ERS which eventually resulted in apoptosis
      in chicken liver. As the same time, the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway also regulated the 
      combined effective of MDM2-p53, which leaned liver cells to G1/S blocking. Our
      findings support the potential of SELK in maintain the health of chicken liver,
      and indicate that adding proper amount of Se on the daily dietary may alleviate
      the deficiency of selenium.

      hERG K(+) channel under hypoxia.

AB  - Clinically, hypoxia is a major risk factor for long QT syndrome (LQTS), which is 
      associated with many diseases, such as myocardial ischemia. LQTS can be caused by
      the deficiency of hERG, a potassium ion channel that plays a key role in cardiac 
      repolarization. Modifications such as acetylation of histones or non-histone
      proteins can affect the protein expression. In the present study, we explored the
      mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced LQTS and a potential reversal strategy.
      Experiments were performed under hypoxia to determine transcriptional and
      post-transcriptional expression changes. We used real-time PCR, chromatin
      immunoprecipitation assay, and western blotting to determine the histones
      acetylation in the hERG gene and the mechanism. Molecular docking, western
      blotting, IP, and patch -clamp assay were performed to determine the acetylation 
      and ubiquitination levels of hERG protein and the mechanism. hERG mRNA and
      protein expression were found to decrease under hypoxia. The histone
      deacetylation level increased under hypoxia at both H3K27 and H4 of the hERG
      gene. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the key enzymes for the mechanism. HDAC6 directly
      interacts with hERG. The acetylation level of hERG decreased and the
      ubiquitination level of hERG increased under hypoxia. The inhibitors of HDAC1,
      HDAC2, and HDAC6 could reverse the reduction of hERG mRNA and hERG protein
      expression under hypoxia. In conclusion, deacetylation of hERG gene-associated
      histones and hERG protein might be the mechanisms for LQTS in patients with
      hypoxia, and the inhibition of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC6 might be a promising
      reversal strategy for reducing hERG expression under different pathological
      conditions.

TI  - Oral digoxin effects on exercise performance, K(+) regulation and skeletal muscle
      Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase in healthy humans.
LID - 10.1113/JP283017 [doi]
AB  - We investigated whether digoxin lowered muscle Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase (NKA),
      impaired muscle performance and exacerbated exercise K(+) disturbances. Ten
      healthy adults ingested digoxin (0.25 mg; DIG) or placebo (CON) for 14 days and
      performed quadriceps strength and fatiguability, finger flexion (FF,
      105%peak-workrate , 3 x 1 min, fourth bout to fatigue) and leg cycling (LC, 10
      min at 33% V O 2 peak ${\rm{V}}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{\rm{2}}{\rm{peak}}}$ and 67% V O 2
      peak ${\rm{V}}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{\rm{2}}{\rm{peak}}}$ , 90% V O 2 peak
      ${\rm{V}}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{\rm{2}}{\rm{peak}}}$ to fatigue) trials using a
      double-blind, crossover, randomised, counter-balanced design. Arterial (a) and
      antecubital venous (v) blood was sampled (FF, LC) and muscle biopsied (LC, rest, 
      67% V O 2 peak ${\rm{V}}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{\rm{2}}{\rm{peak}}}$ , fatigue, 3 h after
      exercise). In DIG, in resting muscle, [(3) H]-ouabain binding site content
      (OB-Fab ) was unchanged; however, bound-digoxin removal with Digibind revealed
      total ouabain binding (OB+Fab ) increased (8.2%, P = 0.047), indicating 7.6%
      NKA-digoxin occupancy. Quadriceps muscle strength declined in DIG (-4.3%, P =
      0.010) but fatiguability was unchanged. During LC, in DIG (main effects), time to
      fatigue and [K(+) ]a were unchanged, whilst [K(+) ]v was lower (P = 0.042) and
      [K(+) ]a-v greater (P = 0.004) than in CON; with exercise (main effects), muscle 
      OB-Fab was increased at 67% V O 2 peak
      ${\rm{V}}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{\rm{2}}{\rm{peak}}}$ (per wet-weight, P = 0.005; per
      protein P = 0.001) and at fatigue (per protein, P = 0.003), whilst [K(+) ]a ,
      [K(+) ]v and [K(+) ]a-v were each increased at fatigue (P = 0.001). During FF, in
      DIG (main effects), time to fatigue, [K(+) ]a , [K(+) ]v and [K(+) ]a-v were
      unchanged; with exercise (main effects), plasma [K(+) ]a , [K(+) ]v , [K(+) ]a-v 
      and muscle K(+) efflux were all increased at fatigue (P = 0.001). Thus, muscle
      strength declined, but functional muscle NKA content was preserved during DIG,
      despite elevated plasma digoxin and muscle NKA-digoxin occupancy, with K(+)
      disturbances and fatiguability unchanged. KEY POINTS: The Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase
      (NKA) is vital in regulating skeletal muscle extracellular potassium
      concentration ([K(+) ]), excitability and plasma [K(+) ] and thereby also in
      modulating fatigue during intense contractions. NKA is inhibited by digoxin,
      which in cardiac patients lowers muscle functional NKA content ([(3) H]-ouabain
      binding) and exacerbates K(+) disturbances during exercise. In healthy adults, we
      found that digoxin at clinical levels surprisingly did not reduce functional
      muscle NKA content, whilst digoxin removal by Digibind antibody revealed an
      approximately 8% increased muscle total NKA content. Accordingly, digoxin did not
      exacerbate arterial plasma [K(+) ] disturbances or worsen fatigue during intense 
      exercise, although quadriceps muscle strength was reduced. Thus, digoxin
      treatment in healthy participants elevated serum digoxin, but muscle functional
      NKA content was preserved, whilst K(+) disturbances and fatigue with intense
      exercise were unchanged. This resilience to digoxin NKA inhibition is consistent 
      with the importance of NKA in preserving K(+) regulation and muscle function.

TI  - Volar Lunate Facet Rim Fractures: K-I Classification and Technique.
PG  - 230-237
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1739144 [doi]
AB  - Background and Purpose It is difficult to capture and safely support a small
      volar lunate facet (VLF) fragment and obtain sufficient initial fixation. The
      challenge in treating VLF rim fractures has resulted in various management
      options. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological 
      outcomes of a consecutive series of VLF rim fractures of the distal radius
      treated surgically and to report the Kondo-Imatani (K-I) classification of these 
      fractures, using computed tomography (CT) images and surgical technique, which is
      termed the Plate buttress and Double tiered subchondral support (PD) technique.
      Patients and Methods A retrospective review was conducted on 35 patients with VLF
      rim fractures that included postoperative clinical evaluations, CT images, and
      radiographs. Description of Technique The PD technique to stabilize the VLF
      fragment with an anatomical and low-profile volar locking plate (VLP). Results
      All fractures healed at the final follow-up; Mayo wrist performance score average
      was 81.7 points (45-100), and the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and
      hand (quick-DASH) score average was 9.5 points (0-31.8), showing relatively good 
      clinical results. Conclusion VLF rim fragments are not amenable to standard VLP
      fixation. Unstable fixation may result in postoperative correction loss, aseptic 
      necrosis, malunion, radiocarpal subluxation, and wrist dysfunction. This report
      described the K-I classification for VLF rim fractures of the distal radius and
      surgical technique, termed the PD technique, to stabilize the VLF rim fragment
      with an anatomical and low-profile VLP. Level of Evidence This is a Level IV,
      case series study.

TI  - Vitamin K antagonist reversal strategies: Systematic review and network
      meta-analysis from the AABB.
LID - 10.1111/trf.17010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation requires urgent reversal in cases of life-threatening
      bleeding or invasive procedures. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Network meta-analysis 
      for comparing the safety and efficacy of warfarin reversal strategies including
      plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). RESULTS: Seven studies
      including 594 subjects using reversal agents plasma, 3-factor-PCC (Uman Complex
      and Konyne), and 4-factor-PCC (Beriplex/KCentra, Octaplex, and Cofact) met
      inclusion criteria. Compared with plasma, patients receiving Cofact probably have
      a higher rate of international normalized ratio (INR) correction (risk difference
      [RD] 499 more per 1000 patients, 95% confidence interval [CI], 176-761, low
      certainty[LC]); higher reversal of bleeding (323 more per 1000 patients, 11-344
      more, LC); and fewer transfusion requirements (0.96 fewer units, 1.65-0.27 fewer,
      LC). Patients receiving Beriplex/KCentra probably have a higher rate of INR
      correction (476 more per 1000 patients, 332-609 more, LC); higher reversal of
      bleeding (127 more per 1000 patients, 43 fewer to 236 more); and similar
      transfusion requirements (0.01 fewer units, 0.31 fewer to 0.28 more,
      high/moderate certainty). Patients receiving Octaplex probably have a higher rate
      of INR correction (RD 579 more per 1000 patients, 189-825 more, LC). CONCLUSIONS:
      PCCs probably provide an advantage in INR reversal compared to plasma. There was 
      no added risk of adverse events with PCCs.

TI  - Isolation and identification of an endophytic bacteria Bacillus sp. K-9
      exhibiting biocontrol activity against potato common scab.
PG  - 483
LID - 10.1007/s00203-022-02989-5 [doi]
AB  - Potato scab is an important soil-borne disease that can significantly reduce the 
      quality and economic value of potatoes. The purpose of this study was to isolate,
      screen and identify endophytic bacteria that have antagonistic and control
      effects on potato scab disease, and to determine the control effect and yield
      traits of the selected strains on potato scab disease in field conditions. A
      bacterial strain K-9 was isolated from the junction between scab spot and healthy
      epidermis of potato tuber. The K-9 strain was identified as Bacillus sp. through 
      morphological, physiological and biochemical characterization, and 16S rDNA and
      gyrB gene sequence analysis. The diameter of the inhibition zone of strain K-9
      against Streptomyces scabies on the YME plate was 3.82 cm. The K-9 strain could
      inhibit eight types of crop pathogens, with the highest inhibition rate (70.39%) 
      against another soil-borne potato disease (potato black scurf). In the field
      test, the control effect of K-9 strain against potato scab was not significantly 
      different from that of mixed bacteria or chemical agents, but the disease index
      and the scab index in the K-9 treatment were significantly lower than in the
      control. The potato yield in the K-9 treatment was 12.44% higher than the
      control. In summary, the K-9 strain can prevent not only potato scab, but also
      increase potato yield. Therefore, the endophytic bacterial K-9 strain may be a
      potential biological control agent.

      osteosynthesis of the clavicle : A case report].
LID - 10.1007/s00113-022-01217-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lateral clavicle fractures can be treated both conservatively and
      surgically depending on the fracture classification. Different surgical
      techniques have been described for the operative treatment. The selection of the 
      appropriate technique is decisive for the functional outcome and healing process 
      without complications. CASE: We report on a patient with a secondary dislocation 
      of two Kirschner wires after Kirschner wire osteosynthesis. The secondary
      dislocation caused one of the wires to migrate into the mediastinum and pulmonary
      tissue, directly under the aortic arch. To prevent further migration with
      potential damage to surrounding structures, a uniportal video-assisted
      thoracoscopy was performed to retrieve the wire. CONCLUSION: The treatment of
      lateral clavicle fractures should be performed with bent Kirschner wires as they 
      can otherwise lead to severe complications including the occurrence of
      pseudarthrosis or secondary migration of the material. Safe and stable surgical
      techniques (plate osteosynthesis, hybrid treatment) should be preferred if they
      are available.

AB  - Antimony-based alloys have appealed to an ever-increasing interest for potassium 
      ion storage due to their high theoretical capacity and safe voltage. However,
      sluggish kinetics and the large radius of K(+) lead to limited rate performance
      and severe capacity fading. In this Letter, highly dispersed antimony-bismuth
      alloy nanoparticles confined in carbon fibers are fabricated through an
      electrospinning technology followed by heat treatment. The BiSb nanoparticles are
      uniformly confined into the carbon fibers, which facilitate rapid electron
      transport and inhibit the volume change during cycling owing to the synergistic
      effect of the BiSb alloy and carbon confinement engineering. Furthermore, the
      effect of a potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) electrolyte with different 
      concentrations has been investigated. Theoretical calculation demonstrates that
      the incorporation of Bi metal is favorable for potassium adsorption. The
      combination of delicate nanofiber morphology and electrolyte chemistry endows the
      fiber composite with an improved reversible capacity of 274.4 mAh g(-1),
      promising rate capability, and cycling stability upon 500 cycles.

AB  - The enzyme Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) is important in the heart. Reductions in NKA
      activity and expression have often been observed in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD)-related heart injury. Previously, our group found that an antibody
      targeting the NKA1alpha1 subunit's DR extracellular region
      ((897)DVEDSYGQQWTYEQR(911)) stimulated NKA activities and produced
      cardioprotective effects against ischemic injury and isoproterenol-induced
      cardiac remodeling. In here, we assessed whether DRm217, a specific DR antibody, 
      exhibits cardioprotective effects in chronic renal failure models. In 5/6
      nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) surgery to mimic CKD in Sprague Dawley rat, we observed that
      NKA activity and expression were depressed in the hearts of 5/6 Nx rats. DRm217, 
      an NKA DR region antibody, alleviated heart hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis
      under 5/6 Nx conditions. Further studies revealed that DRm217 inhibited Src
      activation and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in hearts under 5/6
      Nx conditions. Our findings imply that NKA could be a treatment target in
      CKD-related cardiac diseases. Prevention of CKD-induced myocardial injury by
      DRm217 provides an appealing therapeutic alternative.

TI  - K i -67/MIB-1 and Recurrence in Pituitary Adenoma.
PG  - e580-e590
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1735874 [doi]
AB  - Objectives K i -67/MIB-1 is a marker of cellular proliferation used as a
      pathological parameter in the clinical assessment of pituitary adenomas, where
      its expression has shown utility in predicting the invasiveness of these tumors. 
      However, studies have shown variable results when using K i -67/MIB-1 association
      with recurrence. The purpose of this study is to determine if a high K i
      -67/MIB-1 labeling index (LI) is predictive of recurrence in pituitary adenomas. 
      Methods A retrospective chart review was performed for patients undergoing
      pituitary adenoma resection with at least 1 year of follow-up. Additionally,
      systematic data searches were performed and included studies that correlated
      recurrence rate to K i -67/MIB-1 LI. Our institutional data were included in a
      synthesis with previously published data. Results Our institutional review
      included 79 patients with a recurrence rate of 26.6%. We found that 8.8% of our
      patients had a high K i -67/MIB-1 LI (>3%); however, high K i -67/MIB-1 was not
      associated with recurrence. The systematic review identified 244 articles and 49 
      full-text articles that were assessed for eligibility. Quantitative analysis was 
      performed on 30 articles including our institutional data and 18 studies reported
      recurrence by level of K i -67/MIB-1 LI. Among studies that compared K i
      -67/MIB-1 >/=3 vs. <3%, 10 studies reported odds ratios (OR) greater than 1 of
      which 6 were statistically significant. A high K i -67/MIB-1 had higher odds of
      recurrence via the pooled odds ratio (OR = 4.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
      2.31-7.42). Conclusion This systematic review suggests that a high K i -67/MIB-1 
      should prompt an increased duration of follow-up due to the higher odds of
      recurrence of pituitary adenoma.

TI  - A K(+)-sensitive AND-gate dual-mode probe for simultaneous tumor imaging and
      malignancy identification.
PG  - nwac080
LID - 10.1093/nsr/nwac080 [doi]
AB  - Although molecular imaging probes have the potential to non-invasively diagnose a
      tumor, imaging probes that can detect a tumor and simultaneously identify tumor
      malignancy remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a potassium ion (K(+)) sensitive 
      dual-mode nanoprobe (KDMN) for non-invasive tumor imaging and malignancy
      identification, which operates via a cascaded 'AND' logic gate controlled by
      inputs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging (FI) signals.
      We encapsulate commercial K(+) indicators into the hollow cavities of magnetic
      mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which are subsequently coated with a
      K(+)-selective membrane that exclusively permits the passage of K(+) while
      excluding other cations. The KDMN can readily accumulate in tumors and enhance
      the MRI contrast after systemic administration. Spatial information of the tumor 
      lesion is thus accessible via MRI and forms the first layer of the 'AND' gate.
      Meanwhile, the KDMN selectively captures K(+) and prevents interference from
      other cations, triggering a K(+)-activated FI signal as the second layer of the
      'AND' gate in the case of a malignant tumor with a high extracellular K(+) level.
      This dual-mode imaging approach effectively eliminates false positive or negative
      diagnostic results and allows for non-invasive imaging of tumor malignancy with
      high sensitivity and accuracy.

PG  - 3208-3222
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.019 [doi]
AB  - Characterizing metagenomes via kmer-based, database-dependent taxonomic
      classification has yielded key insights into underlying microbiome dynamics.
      However, novel approaches are needed to track community dynamics and genomic flux
      within metagenomes, particularly in response to perturbations. We describe KOMB, 
      a novel method for tracking genome level dynamics within microbiomes. KOMB
      utilizes K-core decomposition to identify Structural variations (SVs),
      specifically, population-level Copy Number Variation (CNV) within microbiomes.
      K-core decomposition partitions the graph into shells containing nodes of induced
      degree at least K, yielding reduced computational complexity compared to prior
      approaches. Through validation on a synthetic community, we show that KOMB
      recovers and profiles repetitive genomic regions in the sample. KOMB is shown to 
      identify functionally-important regions in Human Microbiome Project datasets, and
      was used to analyze longitudinal data and identify keystone taxa in Fecal
      Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) samples. In summary, KOMB represents a novel
      graph-based, taxonomy-oblivious, and reference-free approach for tracking CNV
      within microbiomes. KOMB is open source and available for download at

      Function in Rat Cerebral Artery Smooth Muscle Cells.

LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.871968 [doi]
AB  - Fibronectin (FN) enhances K(+) channel activity by integrin-mediated mechanisms. 
      As vascular smooth muscle (VSM) K(+) channels mediate vasodilation, we
      hypothesized that modification of fibronectin, via advanced non-enzymatic
      glycation, would alter signaling of this extracellular matrix protein through
      these channels. Bovine FN (1 mg/ml) was glycated (gFN) for 5 days using
      methylglyoxal (50 mM), and albumin was similarly glycated as a non-matrix protein
      control. VSM cells were isolated from rat cerebral arteries for measurement of
      macroscopic K(+) channel activity using whole cell patch clamp methodology.
      Pharmacological inhibitors, iberiotoxin (0.1 muM) and 4-aminopyridine (0.1 mM),
      were used to identify contributions of large-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated, K(+) 
      channels and voltage-gated K(+) channels, respectively. Compared with baseline,
      native FN enhanced whole cell K(+) current in a concentration-dependent manner,
      whereas gFN inhibited basal current. Furthermore, native albumin did not enhance 
      basal K(+) current, but the glycated form (gAlb) caused inhibition. gFN was shown
      to impair both the Kv and BKCa components of total macroscopic K(+) current.
      Anti-integrin alpha5 and beta1 antibodies attenuated the effects of both FN and
      gFN on macroscopic K(+) current at +70 mV. Consistent with an action on BKCa
      activity, FN increased, whereas gFN decreased the frequency of spontaneous
      transient outward current (STOCs). In contrast, gAlb inhibited whole cell K(+)
      current predominantly through Kv, showing little effect on STOCs. A
      function-blocking, anti-RAGE antibody partially reversed the inhibitory effects
      of gFN, suggesting involvement of this receptor. Further, gFN caused production
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by isolated VSMCs as revealed by the fluorescent
      indicator, DHE. Evoked ROS production was attenuated by the RAGE blocking
      antibody. Collectively, these studies identify ion channel-related mechanisms
      (integrin and ROS-mediated) by which protein glycation may modify VSMC function.

TI  - Mucilaginibacter sp. K Improves Growth and Induces Salt Tolerance in Nonhost
      Plants via Multilevel Mechanisms.
PG  - 938697
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.938697 [doi]
AB  - Soil salinity negatively modulates plant growth and development, contributing to 
      severe decreases in the growth and production of crops. Mucilaginibacter sp. K is
      a root endophytic bacterium that was previously reported by our laboratory to
      stimulate growth and confer salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
      The main purpose of the present study is to elucidate the physiological and
      molecular machinery responsible for the prospective salt tolerance as imparted by
      Mucilaginibacter sp. K. We first report that auxin, gibberellin, and MPK6
      signalings were required for strain K-induced growth promotion and salt tolerance
      in Arabidopsis. Then, this strain was assessed as a remediation strategy to
      improve maize performance under salinity stress. Under normal growth conditions, 
      the seed vigor index, nitrogen content, and plant growth were significantly
      improved in maize. After NaCl exposure, strain K significantly promoted the
      growth of maize seedlings, ameliorated decline in chlorophyll content and reduced
      accretion of MDA and ROS compared with the control. The possible mechanisms
      involved in salt resistance in maize could be the improved activities of SOD and 
      POD (antioxidative system) and SPS (sucrose biosynthesis), upregulated content of
      total soluble sugar and ABA, and reduced Na(+) accumulation. These physiological 
      changes were then confirmed by induced gene expression for ion transportation,
      photosynthesis, ABA biosynthesis, and carbon metabolism. In summary, these
      results suggest that strain K promotes plant growth through increases in
      photosynthesis and auxin- and MPK6-dependent pathways; it also bestows salt
      resistance on plants through protection against oxidative toxicity, Na(+)
      imbalance, and osmotic stress, along with the activation of auxin-, gibberellin-,
      and MPK6-dependent signaling pathways. This is the first detailed report of maize
      growth promotion by a Mucilaginibacter sp. strain from wild plant. This strain
      could be used as a favorable biofertilizer and a salinity stress alleviator for
      maize, with further ascertainment as to its reliability of performance under
      field conditions and in the presence of salt stress.

BTI - Evidence review for COVID-19 call for evidence: Vaccine uptake in the general
      population: Evidence review K
AB  - The UK has a routine vaccination schedule covering key vaccinations for different
      stages in life including childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, and old age (65 years
      and older). Current practice is for healthcare practitioners to advise people to 
      accept these vaccinations at the relevant times unless contraindicated. According
      to UKHSA (previously known as Public Health England), the COVID-19 pandemic has
      reduced childhood routine vaccination rates. This is likely to continue to
      disrupt routine vaccinations in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain
      population groups (such as Gypsy, Roma and Travellers, refugees and asylum
      seekers) have lower levels of vaccination than the general public and additional 
      or different actions may be required to increase their vaccination rates. The
      COVID-19 vaccination programme began during the development of the routine
      vaccination guideline. This has involved the use of multiple setting for
      vaccinations; a wide range of vaccination providers; multiple formats for
      invitations and reminders; extensive information and education campaigns and
      interventions tailored to local communities to try to address inequalities that
      lead to low uptake. The committee were interested in whether any lessons could be
      learned from the COVID-19 vaccination programme and applied to routine
      vaccination programmes to increase uptake. There was limited published evidence
      that met the inclusion criteria for the reviews in this guideline due to the
      short time that the COVID programme has been in place. This evidence was
      qualitative and is covered in evidence review B (in the section on 0-5 year
      olds). Given the potential relevance of these programmes to the successful
      delivery of vaccinations in the UK, a call for evidence was made, looking for
      evidence specifically related to the COVID-19 vaccination programmes, their
      effectiveness and any barriers and facilitators to vaccination. This evidence was
      intended to be used as a source of indirect evidence to identify effective
      interventions that could be applied to routine vaccination programmes to improve 
      uptake. In addition, it was envisaged that the qualitive evidence might provide
      additional barriers or facilitators to uptake that were not covered in the
      existing evidence (review B), particularly focusing on areas or communities with 
      low uptake such as certain ethnic minority communities. This call for evidence
      used the protocols and review questions detailed in Appendix A, which are
      summarised in Table 1 and Table 2.

TI  - Influenza A virus polymerase acidic protein E23G/K substitutions weaken key
      baloxavir drug-binding contacts with minimal impact on replication and
      transmission.
PG  - e1010698
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010698 [doi]
AB  - Baloxavir marboxil (BXM) is approved for treating uncomplicated influenza. The
      active metabolite baloxavir acid (BXA) inhibits cap-dependent endonuclease
      activity of the influenza virus polymerase acidic protein (PA), which is
      necessary for viral transcription. Treatment-emergent E23G or E23K (E23G/K) PA
      substitutions have been implicated in reduced BXA susceptibility, but their
      effect on virus fitness and transmissibility, their synergism with other BXA
      resistance markers, and the mechanisms of resistance have been insufficiently
      studied. Accordingly, we generated point mutants of circulating seasonal
      influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses carrying E23G/K substitutions. Both
      substitutions caused 2- to 13-fold increases in the BXA EC50. EC50s were higher
      with E23K than with E23G and increased dramatically (138- to 446-fold) when these
      substitutions were combined with PA I38T, the dominant BXA resistance marker.
      E23G/K-substituted viruses exhibited slightly impaired replication in MDCK and
      Calu-3 cells, which was more pronounced with E23K. In ferret transmission
      experiments, all viruses transmitted to direct-contact and airborne-transmission 
      animals, with only E23K+I38T viruses failing to infect 100% of animals by
      airborne transmission. E23G/K genotypes were predominantly stable during
      transmission events and through five passages in vitro. Thermostable PA-BXA
      interactions were weakened by E23G/K substitutions and further weakened when
      combined with I38T. In silico modeling indicated this was caused by E23G/K
      altering the placement of functionally important Tyr24 in the endonuclease
      domain, potentially decreasing BXA binding but at some cost to the virus. These
      data implicate E23G/K, alone or combined with I38T, as important markers of
      reduced BXM susceptibility, and such mutants could emerge and/or transmit among
      humans.

AB  - Samanea tubulosa Benth. it has been widely used in traditional medicine to treat 
      inflammatory processes. The present study aimed to investigate the
      antinociceptive effect and mechanism of action of the fractions obtained from the
      Samanea tubulosa pods in mice. The antinociceptive activity was evaluated in
      formalin, capsaicin and glutamate tests and the. The possible mechanisms of
      action involved in the antinociceptive effect of the hexane and ethyl acetate
      fraction in the opioid system, also the the K + ATP channels and the L-arigine
      pathways of nitric oxide were evaluated. The chemical characterization analysis
      revealed in the hexane fraction the presence of triterpenes such as lupenone and 
      lupeol. In the glutamate test, the hexane and ethyl acetate fractions showed
      antinociceptive activity at the dose of 12.5 and 25 mg kg-1. The antinociception 
      produced by the hexane and ethyl acetate fractions was significantly reversed by 
      naloxone, indicating that the fractions act through the opioid pathway.
      Antinociceptive response of the ethyl acetate fraction was blocked by
      glibenclamide, indicating that this fraction acts via the K + ATP channels
      activation. It is concluded that the fractions under study exert antinociceptive 
      activity possibly related to the opioid route and through K+ ATP channels
      activation.

AB  - Herein we present the use of a Gemini surfactant and reverse froth flotation to
      efficiently separate magnetite from quartz and produce iron ore at 273 K. This
      surfactant achieved an obviously superior flotation performance (TFe recovery
      increased by 48.18%), and the dosage of the Gemini surfactant was three times
      less than that of a conventional monomeric surfactant. Our findings are expected 
      to serve as a general guide to design a new and excellent collector for
      high-efficiency mineral flotation and to lead to an efficient and clean
      development of mineral resources.

TI  - Association of Vitamin K Insufficiency as Evaluated by Serum Undercarboxylated
      Osteocalcin With Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
PG  - 865178
LID - 10.3389/fragi.2022.865178 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is the state of having a reduced ability to recover from stress.
      Intervention in frailty is important for fulfilling healthy longevity. Vitamin K 
      is a fat-soluble vitamin contained in vegetables and fermented foods. Although
      vitamin K is shown to be associated with several age-related diseases, studies on
      the association of vitamin K intake and frailty in the elderly population are
      limited. In the present study, a total of 800 community-dwelling older adults
      (mean age = 75.9) were recruited for a comprehensive geriatric health
      examination, including frailty evaluation based on the Japanese version of the
      Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. Serum concentrations of total osteocalcin
      (OC) and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) were measured. The ratio of ucOC
      and OC (ucOC/OC), which reflects vitamin K insufficiency, was calculated for each
      participant, and the values were divided into quartiles. A binary logistic
      regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of frailty for each
      quartile of ucOC/OC, with the lowest quartile as the reference. Significant
      association of frailty and the highest quartile of ucOC/OC was found with the
      odds ratio of 2.49 (p = 0.023) with adjustment with age, sex, body mass index,
      dietary intake, and several clinical characteristics. When the analysis was
      repeated in each component of frailty, the highest quartiles of ucOC/OC had the
      tendency of association with "slow walking speed" and "low activity." Our
      findings demonstrated the association between vitamin K insufficiency and frailty
      in the elderly population. Our analysis also suggests that vitamin K
      insufficiency could be associated with selected components of frailty.

TI  - Overdominant expression of related genes of ion homeostasis improves K(+) content
      advantage in hybrid tobacco leaves.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s12870-022-03719-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Potassium(K(+)) plays a vital role in improving the quality of
      tobacco leaves. However, how to improve the potassium content of tobacco leaves
      has always been a difficult problem in tobacco planting. K(+) content in tobacco 
      hybrid is characterized by heterosis, which can improve the quality of tobacco
      leaves, but its underlying molecular genetic mechanisms remain unclear. RESULTS: 
      Through a two-year field experiment, G70xGDH11 with strong heterosis and
      K326xGDH11 with weak heterosis were screened out. Transcriptome analyses revealed
      that 80.89% and 57.28% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the strong
      and weak heterosis combinations exhibited an overdominant expression pattern,
      respectively. The genes that up-regulated the overdominant expression in the
      strong heterosis hybrids were significantly enriched in the ion homeostasis.
      Genes involved in K(+) transport (KAT1/2, GORK, AKT2, and KEA3), activity
      regulation complex (CBL-CIPK5/6), and vacuole (TPKs) genes were overdominant
      expressed in strong heterosis hybrids, which contributed to K(+) homeostasis and 
      heterosis in tobacco leaves. CONCLUSIONS: K(+) homeostasis and accumulation in
      tobacco hybrids were collectively improved. The overdominant expression of K(+)
      transport and homeostasis-related genes conducted a crucial role in the heterosis
      of K(+) content in tobacco leaves.

AB  - Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received increasing interest for large-scale
      energy storage based on the high natural abundance and low-cost of sodium
      resources. However, owing to the large ionic radius of sodium ion, SIBs anodes
      exhibit sluggish charge kinetic and rapid capacity decay, which severely hindered
      their practical application. In this work, we develop a novel approach to couple 
      two-dimensional (2D) bimetal Co-Ni selenide nanosheets with Ti3C2 MXene
      (Ti3C2/Co0.5Ni0.5Se2) as anode material for SIBs. Specifically, the 2D bimetal
      nanosheets anchoring on MXene substrate can provide high specific capacity and
      alleviate volume expansion. Furthermore, the MXene substrate can shorten the
      diffusion pathway of sodium-ion and enhance electronic conductivity. The
      Ti3C2/Co0.5Ni0.5Se2 delivers a superior rate performance of 337 mAh g(-1) at 3000
      mA g(-1) and excellent stability of 338 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) after 600
      cycles. The presented strategy from combination of MXene and 2D bimetallic
      selenide may pave a way for the design and synthesis of high-performance SIBs
      anode materials.

TI  - Significant enhancement of scintillation performance by inducing oxygen vacancies
      in alkali metal ion (A(+) = Li(+), Na(+), K(+))-incorporated (Lu, Sc)BO3:Ce.
PG  - 11295-11301
LID - 10.1039/d2dt01432g [doi]
AB  - The incorporation of Sc(3+) can stabilize calcite-phase LuBO3:Ce(3+) to grow
      large-sized single crystals but leads to the significant degradation of
      scintillation performance. In the present work, alkali metal ion (A(+) = Li(+),
      Na(+), K(+))-incorporated (Lu, A, Sc)BO3:Ce was rapidly synthesized in batches
      via a high-throughput sol-gel method. The aliovalent substitution of Lu(3+) with 
      A(+) is balanced by the generation of oxygen vacancies by forming complexes.
      Thanks to the increased oxygen vacancies, the luminescence and XEL intensity of
      (Lu, Li, Sc)BO3:Ce are significantly enhanced by 2.2 times and 1.9 times,
      respectively. Further, the incorporation of A(+) is attributed to the improved
      transition efficiency of charge carriers. The prepared scintillation screen
      fabricated with LASBO:Ce and PMMA shows that the spatial resolution can reach 8.6
      lp mm(-1), indicating its potential application in efficient and low-cost
      non-destructive X-ray detection. This work is of great significance in improving 
      the luminescence and scintillation performance of (Lu, Sc)BO3:Ce single crystals 
      and thin films and their application in the scintillation field.

AB  - The installation of electron-withdrawing functional groups at the carbocyclic
      backbone of aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands is a versatile method for
      influencing the electronic properties of the resulting ATI complexes. We report
      here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a phenylsulfinyl substituent in
      the backbone. It is demonstrated that the sulfinyl group actively contributes to 
      the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with neutral
      donor ligands such as thf or pyridine in the solid state (XRD), in solution (DOSY
      NMR spectroscopy), and in the gas phase (DFT). The impact of the phenylsulfinyl
      group on the redox properties of the complexes have been investigated and access 
      to sodium sodiate species through ligand-induced disproportionation has been
      studied. Transfer of the ATI ligand to the heavy p-block element bismuth has been
      demonstrated. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear and
      DOSY NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, DFT calculations, and single-crystal
      X-ray diffraction analysis.

TI  - Ginsenoside compound K reduces the progression of Huntington's disease via the
      inhibition of oxidative stress and overactivation of the ATM/AMPK pathway.
PG  - 572-584
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2021.11.003 [doi]
AB  - Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by
      the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. The major
      pathogenic pathways underlying HD involve the impairment of cellular energy
      homeostasis and DNA damage in the brain. The protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia
      mutated (ATM) is an important regulator of the DNA damage response. ATM is
      involved in the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
      suggesting that AMPK plays a critical role in response to DNA damage. Herein, we 
      demonstrated that expression of polyQ-expanded mutant Htt (mHtt) enhanced the
      phosphorylation of ATM. Ginsenoside is the main and most effective component of
      Panax ginseng. However, the protective effect of a ginsenoside (compound K, CK)
      in HD remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Methods: This study
      used the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD and performed behavioral tests,
      survival rate, histological analyses, and immunoblot assays. Results: The
      systematic administration of CK into R6/2 mice suppressed the activation of
      ATM/AMPK and reduced neuronal toxicity and mHTT aggregation. Most importantly, CK
      increased neuronal density and lifespan and improved motor dysfunction in R6/2
      mice. Conversely, CK enhanced the expression of Bcl2 protected striatal cells
      from the toxicity induced by the overactivation of mHtt and AMPK. Conclusions:
      Thus, the oral administration of CK reduced the disease progression and markedly 
      enhanced lifespan in the transgenic mouse model (R6/2) of HD.

      Potential Nuclear Waste Forms.
PG  - 11232-11242

AB  - A series of alkali metal rare-earth borates were prepared via high-temperature
      flux crystal growth, and their structures were characterized by single crystal
      X-ray diffraction (SXRD). Na3Ln(BO3)2 (Ln = La-Lu) crystallize in the monoclinic 
      space group P21/n, the potassium series K3Ln(BO3)2 (Ln = La-Tb) crystallize in
      the orthorhombic space group Pnma, while the Ln = Dy, Ho, Tm, Yb analogues
      crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnnm. To demonstrate the generality
      of this synthetic technique, high-entropy oxide (HEO) compositions
      K3Nd0.15(1)Eu0.20(1)Gd0.20(1)Dy0.22(1)Ho0.23(1)(BO3)2 and
      K3Nd0.26(1)Eu0.29(1)Ho0.22(1)Tm0.14(1)Yb0.10(1)(BO3)2 were obtained in single
      crystal form. Radiation damage investigations determined that these borates have 
      a high radiation damage tolerance. To assess whether trivalent actinide analogues
      of Na3Ln(BO3)2 and K3Ln(BO3)2 would be stable, density functional theory was used
      to calculate their enthalpies of formation, which are favorable.

TI  - Using Targeted Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry to Rapidly Detect
      beta-Lactam, Aminoglycoside, and Fluoroquinolone Resistance Mechanisms in Blood
      Cultures Growing E. coli or K. pneumoniae.

AB  - New and rapid antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance testing methods are
      required for bacteria from positive blood cultures. In this study, a
      multiplex-targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
      assay was developed and validated for the detection of beta-lactam,
      aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms in blood cultures
      growing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae complex. Selected targets were 
      the beta-lactamases SHV, TEM, OXA-1-like, CTX-M-1-like, CMY-2-like, chromosomal
      E. coli AmpC (cAmpC), OXA-48-like, NDM, VIM, and KPC; the
      aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes AAC(3)-Ia, AAC(3)-II, AAC(3)-IV, AAC(3)-VI,
      AAC(6')-Ib, ANT(2 ' ' )-I, and APH(3')-VI; the 16S-RMTases ArmA, RmtB, RmtC, and 
      RmtF; the quinolone resistance mechanisms QnrA, QnrB, AAC(6')-Ib-cr; the wildtype
      quinolone resistance determining region of GyrA; and the E. coli porins OmpC and 
      OmpF. The developed assay was evaluated using 100 prospectively collected
      positive blood cultures, and 148 negative blood culture samples spiked with
      isolates previously collected from blood cultures or isolates carrying less
      prevalent resistance mechanisms. The time to result was approximately 3 h.
      LC-MS/MS results were compared with whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing results. Overall, there was a high agreement between
      LC-MS/MS results and whole-genome sequencing results. In addition, the majority
      of susceptible and non-susceptible phenotypes were correctly predicted based on
      LC-MS/MS results. Exceptions were the predictions for ciprofloxacin and
      amoxicillin/clavulanic acid that matched with the phenotype in 85.9 and 63.7% of 
      the isolates, respectively. Targeted LC-MS/MS based on parallel reaction
      monitoring can be applied for the rapid and accurate detection of various
      resistance mechanisms in blood cultures growing E. coli or K. pneumoniae complex.

      Carbapenem-Resistant K. pneumoniae-Infected Patients With Different Kidney
      Statuses.
PG  - 780991
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.780991 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) is the most common
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae with high mortality.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) has exhibited excellent in vitro activity in vivo
      against CRKP. However, the efficacy of CAZ-AVI in KPC-producing CRKP-infected
      patients with different kidney statuses varies, such as renal insufficiency,
      normal renal function, and augmented renal clearance (ARC). We explored the use
      of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to evaluate the concentration and efficacy
      of CAZ-AVI in CRKP-infected patients with different kidney statuses. Methods:
      Serum concentrations for CAZ and AVI were determined by the high-performance
      liquid chromatography method. Bacterial identification, routine susceptibility
      testing, renal function index, and others were performed in standard protocols in
      the hospital's clinical laboratories. Results: In the two patients with ARC, in
      case 1, CAZ-AVI 2.5g q6h was used with good efficacy, and the concentrations were
      up to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets. In Case 2, 2.5 g q8h was
      used with invalid effectiveness, and AVI Cmin was only 0.797 mg/l, which is lower
      than the PK/PD target. Case 3 was renal insufficiency using CAZ-AVI 1.25 q8h, and
      case 4 was normal renal function using 2.5 g q8h. Their concentrations were both 
      up to the PK/PD targets. Conclusion: TDM results demonstrated that CAZ-AVI
      steady-state plasma concentration varies among patients with different kidney
      statuses, providing evidence for the utility of TDM of CAZ-AVI in individualized 
      drug dose adjustment. ARC patients may need more CAZ-AVI daily doses than the
      standard dose.

AB  - In this study, we utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine
      the relationship between different symptoms in cases who died of COVID-19 and
      cases who recovered from it. First, our data was cleared of redundancies, and the
      ten most important variables were selected using a filter-based technique
      (extra-tree classifier). Next, we calculated the Silhouette, Davis Boldin (DB),
      and the mean intra-cluster distance measures to select the optimal number of
      clusters, then clustered the data using both the K-means and hierarchical
      clustering based on Self Organizing Map (SOM) neural network. Our results
      revealed that patients who died of COVID-19 had high mean values in different
      symptoms, but not all patients with this characteristic necessarily died.
      Besides, our result indicated that the patient's age is directly related to the
      hospital duration, and elderly patients are more likely to be assigned to the
      intensive care unit (ICU). However, the patient's sex has the same distribution
      in different groups and does not correlate with other symptoms. In conclusion,
      our results confirmed past studies. Also, this research helps physicians improve 
      medical services by considering other important factors for treating different
      groups of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - We used nicorandil, a K-ATP channel opener, to study the role of these channels
      in the amelioration of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced pancreatic
      injury, and the possible involvement of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
      Forty-two male Wistar rats were included in this study, six were sacrificed for
      extraction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and conducting the
      in-vitro work, the others were included in vivo study and equally divided into
      six groups. Group 1 (sham control), but groups 2-6 were subjected to bilateral
      renal I/R: Group 2 (I/R); Group 3 (I/R-NC), treated with nicorandil; Group 4
      (I/R-MSCs), treated with BM-MSCs; Group 5 (I/R-MSCC), treated with
      nicorandil-preconditioned BM-MSCs; Group 6 (I/R-NC-MSCC), treated with both
      systemic nicorandil and preconditioned BM-MSCC. Renal injury and subsequent
      pancreatic damage were detected in the I/R group by a significant increase in
      serum urea, creatinine, fasting glucose, and pancreatic enzymes. The pancreatic
      tissues showed a reduction in cellularity and a significant decrease in the
      expression of the cell survival pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in the I/R group compared
      to the control. Preconditioning MSCs with nicorandil significantly enhanced the
      proliferation assay and decreased their apoptotic markers. Indeed, combined
      systemic nicorandil and nicorandil-preconditioning maintained survival of MSC in 
      the pancreatic tissue and amelioration of apoptotic markers and pancreatic
      TNF-alpha production. Histologically, all treated groups revealed better
      pancreatic architecture, and increased area % of anti-insulin antibody and CD31, 
      which were all best observed in the NC-MSCC group. Thus, using K-ATP channel
      opener was efficient to enhance PI3K/Akt/mTOR expression levels (in vivo and in
      vitro).

      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase.
PG  - 827334
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.827334 [doi]
AB  - Cytosolic Na + concentrations regulate cardiac excitation-contraction coupling
      and contractility. Inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) activity increases
      cardiac contractility by increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, as increased
      cytosolic Na(+) levels are coupled to less Ca(2+) extrusion and/or increased
      Ca(2+) influx from the Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger. NKA consists of one alpha subunit 
      and one beta subunit, with alpha1 and alpha2 being the main alpha isoforms in
      cardiomyocytes. Substantial evidence suggests that NKAalpha2 is the primary
      regulator of cardiac contractility despite being outnumbered by NKAalpha1 in
      cardiomyocytes. This review will mainly focus on differential regulation and
      subcellular localization of the NKAalpha1 and NKAalpha2 isoforms, and their

TI  - Association of Dietary Vitamin K Intake With Cognition in the Elderly.
PG  - 900887
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.900887 [doi]
AB  - Several previous studies discussed the association between vitamin K (VK) status 
      and cognition. But the association between dietary VK consumption and cognitive
      performance in the elderly was not well understood. Therefore, we investigated
      the correlation between dietary VK intake and the cognition of the elderly. Our
      research used the data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014. The dietary intake of VK was assessed by two 24-h
      dietary recalls. The cognitive function was measured in the survey of NHANES,
      including the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease Word
      Learning subtest (CERAD W-L), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol
      Substitution Test (DSST). Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models 
      were applied to assess the relationship between dietary VK intake and cognition. 
      Compared with the lowest dietary VK intake group, the multivariate-adjusted odds 
      ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of low CERAD W-L score for the
      highest intake group was 0.39 (0.26-0.60), the multivariate-adjusted OR (95% CI) 
      of low AFT score was 0.59 (0.38-0.92), and the multivariate-adjusted OR (95% CI) 
      of low DSST score was 0.44 (0.29-0.65), respectively. There was an L-shaped
      dose-response relationship between dietary VK intake and low CERAD W-L score.
      There was a linear dose-response relationship between dietary VK intake and low
      AFT score, and there was also a linear dose-response relationship for the low
      DSST score. In addition, we also found a negative association between VK from
      vegetables and the risk of low CERAD W-L scores. Dietary VK intake and VK intake 
      from vegetables were inversely related to the risk of low cognitive performance
      of the elderly.

TI  - Summary of Meta-analyses of Studies Involving TIRADS Classifications (EU-TIRADS, 
      ACR-TIRADS, and K-TIRADS) in Evaluating the Malignant Potential of Focal Lesions 
      of The Thyroid Gland.
PG  - 121-129
LID - 10.15557/JoU.2022.0020 [doi]
AB  - Numerous scientific societies around the world have published their TIRADS
      (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) classifications that evaluate the
      risk of malignancy of focal thyroid lesions, presenting different ultrasound
      features for each category and lesion size thresholds to determine eligibility
      for biopsy. The use of such risk estimation systems in focal thyroid lesions
      facilitates the reporting of thyroid ultrasound findings and improves the
      qualification of focal lesions for fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). In this 
      publication, the three most popular TIRADS classifications, European - EU-TIRADS,
      Korean - K-TIRADS, and developed by the American Society of Radiology -
      ACR-TIRADS, are presented and discussed based on a literature review. The results
      of available head-to-head statistical analyses comparing the classifications are 
      also presented. The advantage of the EU-TIRADS and K-TIRADS systems is that they 
      include only the most important ultrasound features, so their application is not 
      time-consuming, and the scores are easy to incorporate into clinical practice.
      ACR-TIRADS, unlike other scales, is based on a unique classification system and
      represents the most comprehensive classification. Each of the five categories of 
      ultrasound features - morphology, echogenicity, shape, margins,
      microcalcifications - are evaluated and assigned a score from 0 to 3, with a
      higher score being associated with a higher risk of cancer. Based on the
      available data, the greatest benefit has been demonstrated for the ACR-TIRADS
      classification, which also has implications for minimising the number of
      unnecessary FNABs. However, limitations related to the heterogeneity of the
      groups analysed in the study, including differences in the populations studied,
      inclusion criteria, proportions of patients of either sexes, and the number of
      malignant lesions analysed, should also be taken into account.

TI  - The Impact of a 1,2,3-Triazole Motif on the Photophysical Behavior of Non-K
      Tetrasubstituted Pyrene with a Substitution Pattern Providing the Long Axial

LID - 4314 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134314 [doi]
AB  - 1,3,6,8-Tetrasubstituted pyrene derivatives with two types of substituents
      (4-(2,2-dimethylpropyloxy)pyridine, 1-decyl-1,2,3-triazole,
      1-benzyl-1,2,3-triazole, and pyrazole), substituted in such a way that provides
      the long axial symmetry, are prepared and characterized in the present study. To 
      the best of our knowledge, the pyrene derivative containing the same heteroaryl
      motif (triazole) but substituted by two various alkyls, straight decyl and
      benzyl-based side chains (C), is reported for the first time. For comparison,
      compounds with one kind of triazole motif and substituted pyridine or pyrazole
      groups were prepared (A and B). The photophysical properties of all molecules
      were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV-Vis spectroscopy
      (absorption and emission spectra, quantum yields, and fluorescence lifetimes).
      The obtained results were compared to analogues substituted at the 1,3,6,8
      positions by one kind of substituent and also with all the
      1,3,6,8-tetrasubstituted pyrenes reported in the literature substituted by two
      kinds of substituents with a substitution pattern that provides long axial
      symmetry. In addition, theoretical studies based on DFT and TD-DFT were performed
      that supported the interpretation of the experimental results. The photophysical 
      properties of tetrasubstituted pyrene derivatives having triazole units at the
      1,8-positions, respectively, and other identical substituents at the 3,6
      positions show the dominance of triazole units in the pyrene framework; the
      dominance is even higher in the case of the substitution of 1,3,6,8 positions by 
      triazoles, but containing two various alkyls.

AB  - The hunt for a cleaner energy carrier leads us to consider a source that produces
      no toxic byproducts. One of the targeted alternatives in this approach is
      hydrogen energy, which, unfortunately, suffers from a lack of efficient storage
      media. Solid-state hydrogen absorption systems, such as lithium amide (LiNH2)
      systems, may store up to 6.5 weight percent hydrogen. However, the temperature of
      hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is too high for practical use. Various molar
      ratios of LiNH2 with sodium hydride (NaH) and potassium hydride (KH) have been
      explored in this paper. The temperature of hydrogenation for LiNH2 combined with 
      KH and NaH was found to be substantially lower than the temperature of individual
      LiNH2. This lower temperature operation of both LiNH2-NaH and LiNH2-KH systems
      was investigated in depth, and the eutectic melting phenomenon was observed.
      Systematic thermal studies of this amide-hydride system in different compositions
      were carried out, which enabled the plotting of a pseudo-binary phase diagram.
      The occurrence of eutectic interaction increased atomic mobility, which resulted 
      in the kinetic modification followed by an increase in the reactivity of two
      materials. For these eutectic compositions, i.e., 0.15LiNH2-0.85NaH and
      0.25LiNH2-0.75KH, the lowest melting temperature was found to be 307 degrees C
      and 235 degrees C, respectively. Morphological studies were used to investigate
      and present the detailed mechanism linked with this phenomenon.

TI  - Damage Progress Classification in AlSi10Mg SLM Specimens by Convolutional Neural 
      Network and k-Fold Cross Validation.
LID - 4428 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15134428 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the damage evolution stages in testing AlSi10Mg specimens
      manufactured using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process are identified using
      Acoustic Emission (AE) technique and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). AE
      signals generated during the testing of AlSi10Mg specimens are recorded and
      analysed to identify their time-frequency features in three different damage
      evolution stages: elastic stage, plastic stage, and fracture stage. Continuous
      Wavelet Transform (CWT) spectrograms are used for the processing of the AE
      signals. The AE signals from each of these stages are then used for training a
      CNN based on SqueezeNet. Moreover, k-fold cross validation is implemented while
      training the modified SqueezeNet to improve the classification efficiency of the 
      network. The trained network shows promising results in classifying the AE
      signals from different damage evolution stages.

TI  - Tumor-Suppressor Role of the alpha1-Na/K-ATPase Signalosome in NASH Related
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
LID - 7359 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137359 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related
      mortality worldwide, with an estimate of 0.84 million cases every year. In
      Western countries, because of the obesity epidemic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) has become the major cause of HCC. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying tumorigenesis of HCC from NASH are largely unknown. We hypothesized
      that the growing uncoupled metabolism during NASH progression to HCC, manifested 
      by lower cell redox status and an apoptotic 'switch' activity, follows a
      dysregulation of alpha1-Na/K-ATPase (NKA)/Src signalosome. Our results suggested 
      that in NASH-related malignancy, alpha1-NKA signaling causes upregulation of the 
      anti-apoptotic protein survivin and downregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein
      Smac/DIABLO via the activation of the PI3K --> Akt pro-survival pathway with
      concomitant inhibition of the FoxO3 circuit, favoring cell division and primary
      liver carcinogenesis. Signalosome normalization using an inhibitory peptide
      resets apoptotic activity in malignant cells, with a significant decrease in
      tumor burden in vivo. Therefore, alpha1-NKA signalosome exercises in HCC the
      characteristic of a tumor suppressor, suggesting alpha1-NKA as a putative target 
      for clinical therapy.

TI  - K(+)-Dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+) Exchanger Isoform 2, Nckx2, Takes Part in the
      Neuroprotection Elicited by Ischemic Preconditioning in Brain Ischemia.
LID - 7128 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137128 [doi]
AB  - Sodium/Calcium exchangers are neuronal plasma membrane antiporters which, by
      coupling Ca(2+) and Na(+) fluxes across neuronal membranes, play a relevant role 
      in brain ischemia. The most brain-expressed isoform among the members of the
      K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger family, NCKX2, is involved in the
      progression of the ischemic lesion, since both its knocking-down and its
      knocking-out worsens ischemic damage. The aim of this study was to elucidate
      whether NCKX2 functions as an effector in the neuroprotection evoked by ischemic 
      preconditioning. For this purpose, we investigated: (1) brain NCKX2 expression
      after preconditioning and preconditioning + ischemia; (2) the contribution of AKT
      and calpain to modulating NCKX2 expression during preconditioning; and (3) the
      effect of NCKX2 knocking-out on the neuroprotection mediated by ischemic
      preconditioning. Our results showed that NCKX2 expression increased in those
      brain regions protected by ischemic preconditioning. These changes were
      p-AKT-mediated since its inhibition prevented NCKX2 up-regulation. More
      interestingly, NCKX2 knocking-out significantly prevented the protection exerted 
      by ischemic preconditioning. Overall, our results suggest that NCKX2 plays a
      fundamental role in the neuroprotective effect mediated by ischemic
      preconditioning and support the idea that the enhancement of its expression and
      activity might represent a reasonable strategy to reduce infarct extension after 
      stroke.

TI  - Transporter NRT1.5/NPF7.3 suppresses primary root growth under low K(+) stress by
      regulating the degradation of PIN-FORMED2.
PG  - 330
LID - 10.1186/s12870-022-03730-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of potassium is one of the main environmental
      factors for modifying the plasticity of root architecture. Many potassium
      channels and transporters are involved in regulating primary root growth in
      response to low potassium stress. NRT1.5/NPF7.3 transporter is a NO3(-)/H(+) and 
      K(+)/H(+) cotransporter, and participates in NO3(-) and K(+) translocation from
      the roots to the shoots. However, the underlying mechanism of NRT1.5-regulated
      primary root growth under low potassium stress is unclear. RESULTS: We show that 
      NRT1.5/NPF7.3 inhibited primary root growth under low potassium conditions by
      regulating the accumulation of PIN2 protein and auxin levels. Under low potassium
      conditions, the mutants nrt1.5 and lks2 exhibited longer primary roots, longer
      meristem regions and elongation zones of primary roots, and more cell activity in
      the meristem region compared to WT plants, revealing the involvement of NRT1.5 in
      LK (low potassium)-inhibition primary root growth. In addition, exogenous auxin
      (IAA), auxin analogue (NAA, 2.4-D) or auxin precursor (IBA) promoted the primary 
      root growth of WT and the complementation line NRT1.5 COM plants. In addition,
      the application of NPA inhibited the primary root growth of the nrt1.5 and lks2
      mutants. Auxin accumulation was higher in the root tip of nrt1.5 plants than in
      WT plants, indicating that NRT1.5 regulates root growth inhibition by regulating 
      auxin distribution. Furthermore, PIN2 was degraded more quickly in nrt1.5 plants 
      under LK stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that NRT1.5 inhibits primary
      root growth by modulating the auxin level in the root tip via the degradation of 
      PIN2.

      ovarian cancer cells.
LID - 10.1007/s13258-022-01280-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among various human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), the HERV-K
      (HML-2) group has been reported to be highly related to cancer. In pancreatic
      cancer cells, shRNA-mediated downregulation of HERV-K env RNA decreases cell
      proliferation and tumor growth through the RAS-ERK-RSK pathway; in colorectal
      cancer, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) of the HERV-K env gene affects tumorigenic
      characteristics through the nupr-1 gene. OBJECTIVE: The effect of HERV-K env KO
      has not been studied in ovarian cancer cell lines. In this study, we analyzed the
      tumorigenic characteristics of ovarian cancer cell lines, including cell
      proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the expression patterns of related
      proteins after CRISPR-Cas9 KO of the HERV-K env gene. METHODS: The HERV-K env
      gene KO was achieved using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in ovarian cancer cell lines
      SKOV3 and OVCAR3. Tumorigenic characteristics including cell proliferation,
      migration, and invasion were analyzed, and related protein expression was
      investigated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: The expression of the HERV-K env 
      gene in KO cells was significantly reduced at RNA and protein levels, and
      tumorigenic characteristics including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
      were significantly reduced. In HERV-K env KO SKOV3 cells, the expression of the
      RB protein was significantly up-regulated and the cyclin B1 protein level was
      significantly reduced. In contrast, in HERV-K env KO OVCAR3 cells, the level of
      phospho-RB protein was significantly reduced, but other protein levels were not
      changed. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that HERV-K env gene KO
      affects cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cells through RB
      and Cyclin B1 proteins, but the specific regulation pattern can differ by cell
      line.

TI  - Human Endogenous Retrovirus K Envelope in Spinal Fluid of Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis Is Toxic.
LID - 10.1002/ana.26452 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Human endogenous retroviruses have been implicated in
      neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
      Expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) subtype HML-2 envelope (Env)
      in human neuronal cultures and in transgenic mice results in neurotoxicity and
      neurodegeneration, and mice expressing HML-2 Env display behavioral and
      neuromuscular characteristics resembling ALS. This study aims to characterize the
      neurotoxic properties of HML-2 Env. METHODS: Env neurotoxicity was detected in
      ALS cerebrospinal fluid and confirmed using recombinant Env protein in a
      cell-based assay and a mouse model. The mechanism of neurotoxicity was assessed
      with immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and Western blot, and by
      screening a panel of inhibitors. RESULTS: We observed that recombinant HML-2 Env 
      protein caused neurotoxicity resulting in neuronal cell death, retraction of
      neurites, and decreased neuronal electrical activity. Injection of the Env
      protein into the brains of mice also resulted in neuronal cell death. HML-2 Env
      protein was also found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with sporadic ALS. 
      The neurotoxic properties of the Env and the cerebrospinal fluid could be rescued
      with the anti-Env antibody. The Env was found to bind to CD98HC complexed to
      beta1 integrin on the neuronal cell surface. Using a panel of compounds to screen
      for their ability to block Env-induced neurotoxicity, we found that several
      compounds were protective and are linked to the beta1 integrin pathway.
      INTERPRETATION: HERV-K Env is released extracellularly in ALS and causes
      neurotoxicity via a novel mechanism. Present results pave the way for new
      treatment strategies in sporadic ALS. ANN NEUROL 2022.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of Nonvitamin K Oral Anticoagulants Rivaroxaban and

      Studies.
PG  - 2756682
LID - 10.1155/2022/2756682 [doi]
AB  - Background: Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the most widely used nonvitamin K oral
      anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This
      meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness and safety of both NOACs versus
      standard of care (SoC) in real-world practice. Methods: Real-world evidence (RWE)
      studies were identified through a systematic literature review conducted between 
      January 2012 and July 2020, using Embase, MEDLINE, and the websites of
      cardiological, hematological, and oncological associations. Eligible RWE studies 
      recruited adult patients with deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism and 
      presented a comparison between rivaroxaban and apixaban versus SoC, consisting
      either of vitamin K antagonists, heparins, or combinations thereof. Hazard ratios
      (HRs) for the comparison between NOACs and SoC were extracted from the relevant
      studies or estimated based on the reported binary data. The between-treatment
      contrasts were reported as HRs with associated 95% confidence intervals. Results:
      A total of 65 RWE studies were identified and considered relevant for the
      meta-analysis. Compared with SoC, both rivaroxaban and apixaban were associated
      with reduced risks of recurrent VTE and a lower rate of major bleeding events.
      Patients treated with rivaroxaban were at a lower risk of all-cause death
      compared with those receiving SoC (HR = 0.56 [0.39-0.80]), while evidence for
      apixaban from the identified studies was insufficient to demonstrate a
      statistically significant change in mortality (HR = 0.66 [0.30-1.47]).
      Conclusion: This analysis indicates that in real-world practice, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban are associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding
      events compared with SoC. Survival benefit in patients treated with rivaroxaban
      was also observed.

TI  - Genomic characterization of lytic bacteriophages A yenL and A yenM infecting ESBL
      K. pneumoniae and its therapeutic potential on biofilm dispersal and in-vivo
      bacterial clearance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging carbapenem resistance and extended spectrum
      beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, are one of the
      critical pathogens for which novel therapeutic alternatives are required on
      urgent basis. Biofilm formation further aids in virulence due to impermeable
      nature. Bacteriophages are bacterial predators which due to their selective, and 
      nontoxic nature can be used as an alternate to counter MDR infections. Hence, the
      current study was intended to isolate, characterize, and develop phage cocktail
      as a possible therapy against ESBL K. pneumoniae. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The
      two-novel bacteriophage A yenL and A yenM were isolated from environmental
      samples and characterized for host specificity and physicochemical stability
      (i.e., temperature and pH). Isolated phages alone or together as cocktail was
      further evaluated for in vitro biofilm eradication and infection clearance using 
      in vivo murine model. Whole genome sequencing was performed for identification,
      evolutionary relationship, and bioinformatics analysis. RESULT: The isolated
      phage A yenL and A yenM belonged to Myoviridae and Siphoviridae family,
      respectively and showed good thermal (-20, 37, 45, and 60C) and pH (5, 7, 9, and 
      11) stability. At MOI of 0.001, both phages displayed short eclipse period of 5
      and 10 min, respectively. Phages alone or together as cocktail showed 50-70%
      eradication of 48 h mature biofilm. Majority of the cells within biofilm was
      found dead as evinced from live dead staining. Atomic force and scanning electron
      microscopic analysis showed distorted biofilm with ruptured cells. The isolated
      phage or their cocktail significantly inhibited K. pneumoniae associated
      mortality in intraperitoneal inoculated mice model CONCLUSION: These findings
      imply that the phage might be a good option for eliminating K. pneumoniae
      infections and further studies could help in development of these phage as a
      bio-control product.

TI  - Applicability of hyperspectral imaging during salinity stress in rice for
      tracking Na+ and K+ levels in planta.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270931 [doi]
AB  - The ratio of Na+ and K+ is an important determinant of the magnitude of Na+
      toxicity and osmotic stress in plant cells. Traditional analytical approaches
      involve destructive tissue sampling and chemical analysis, where real-time
      observation of spatio-temporal experiments across genetic or breeding populations
      is unrealistic. Such an approach can also be very inaccurate and prone to
      erroneous biological interpretation. Analysis by Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is
      an emerging non-destructive alternative for tracking plant nutrient status in a
      time-course with higher accuracy and reduced cost for chemical analysis. In this 
      study, the feasibility and predictive power of HSI-based approach for
      spatio-temporal tracking of Na+ and K+ levels in tissue samples was explored
      using a panel recombinant inbred line (RIL) of rice (Oryza sativa L.;
      salt-sensitive IR29 x salt-tolerant Pokkali) with differential activities of the 
      Na+ exclusion mechanism conferred by the SalTol QTL. In this panel of RILs the
      spectrum of salinity tolerance was represented by FL499 (super-sensitive), FL454 
      (sensitive), FL478 (tolerant), and FL510 (super-tolerant). Whole-plant image
      processing pipeline was optimized to generate HSI spectra during salinity stress 
      at EC = 9 dS m-1. Spectral data was used to create models for Na+ and K+
      prediction by partial least squares regression (PLSR). Three datasets, i.e., mean
      image pixel spectra, smoothened version of mean image pixel spectra, and
      wavelength bands, with wide differences in intensity between control and salinity
      facilitated the prediction models with high R2. The smoothened and filtered
      datasets showed significant improvements over the mean image pixel dataset.
      However, model prediction was not fully consistent with the empirical data. While
      the outcome of modeling-based prediction showed a great potential for improving
      the throughput capacity for salinity stress phenotyping, additional technical
      refinements including tissue-specific measurements is necessary to maximize the
      accuracy of prediction models.

TI  - Near-Quantitative Predictions of the First-Shell Coordination Structure of

      Spectroscopy.
PG  - 6323-6330
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01532 [doi]
AB  - The solvation structure of transition metal ions is important for applications in
      geochemistry, biochemistry, energy storage, and environmental chemistry. We study
      the X-ray absorption pre-edge and near-edge spectra at the K-edge of a nearly
      complete series of hydrated first-row transition metal ions with d orbital
      occupancy from d(2) to d(10). We optimize all of the structures at the density
      functional theory (DFT) level with explicit solvation and then compute the
      pre-edge X-ray absorption spectra with time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) and restricted 
      active space second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2). TDDFT provides accurate
      results for spectra that are dominated by single excitations, while RASPT2
      correctly distinguishes between singly and doubly excited states with
      quantitative accuracy compared with experiment. We analyze the pre-edge features 
      for each metal ion to reveal the impact of the variations in d orbital occupancy 
      on the first-shell coordination environment. We also report the lowest-energy
      ligand field d-d transitions using complete active space second-order
      perturbation theory.

TI  - Strengthen Synergistic Effect of Soft Carbon and Hard Carbon Toward
      High-Performance Anode for K-Ion Battery.
PG  - 31879-31888
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c05633 [doi]
AB  - Synergistic effect of soft carbon and hard carbon has been proven to be useful
      for obtaining excellent anode materials for potassium ion battery, which is
      determined by the mixing degree of precursors. Inspired by the formation of
      proteins in biology, peptide bonds are used to connect the precursors of the two 
      sort of carbon to prepare soft-hard hybrid carbons with stronger synergistic
      effects. The hard carbon domain with nanometer size is so highly distributed in
      the soft carbon that the synergistic effect between two sorts of carbon is
      significantly enhanced. After the optimization, the diffusion coefficient of
      as-prepared hybrid carbon (CSHC3-6-1200) is 10 times larger than that of
      corresponding carbon synthesized by physical method. Consequently, CSHC3-6-1200
      can maintain a specific capacity of 71.6 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of
      1600 mA g(-1). It is believed that this new preparation route may bring a new
      perspective to the development of soft and hard composite carbon material anodes 
      with high power density and ultralong service life.

TI  - Bacillus cereus cytotoxin K triggers gasdermin D-dependent pyroptosis.

AB  - Bacillus cereus is well known as a causative agent of foodborne gastrointestinal 
      diseases and systemic non-gastrointestinal diseases. We have recently identified 
      a pathogenic B. cereus (named H2) from a deep-sea cold-seep. H2 possesses the
      pyroptosis-inducing capacity and contains a number of enterotoxins including
      cytotoxin K (CytK). In the present work, we examined the cytotoxicity of the CytK
      of H2 to human macrophages. CytK bound macrophages by interaction with the plasma
      membrane and caused cellular structure damage. CytK-cell interaction triggered
      rapid pyroptosis mediated by caspase 1-activated gasdermin D (GSDMD).
      CytK-induced pyroptosis required NLRP3 inflammasome activation, K(+) efflux, and 
      intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation. CytK exhibited apparent binding to several
      cytomembrane lipids, in particular phosphatidic acid, which proved to be
      essential to CytK-elicited cell death. Together, these results add new insights
      into the cytotoxic mechanism of CytK.

TI  - PLCbeta-Mediated Depletion of PIP2 and ATP-Sensitive K(+) Channels Are Involved
      in Arginine Vasopressin-Induced Facilitation of Neuronal Excitability and LTP in 
      the Dentate Gyrus.

AB  - Arginine vasopressin (AVP) serves as a neuromodulator in the brain. The
      hippocampus is one of the major targets for AVP, as it has been demonstrated that
      the hippocampus receives vasopressinergic innervation and expresses AVP
      receptors. The dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) serve as a gate governing
      the inflow of information to the hippocampus. High densities of AVP receptors are
      expressed in the DG GCs. However, the roles and the underlying cellular and
      molecular mechanisms of AVP in the DG GCs have not been determined. We addressed 
      this question by recording from the DG GCs in rat hippocampal slices. Our results
      showed that application of AVP concentration-dependently evoked an inward holding
      current recorded from the DG GCs. AVP depolarized the DG GCs and increased their 
      action potential firing frequency. The excitatory effects of AVP were mediated by
      activation of V1a receptors and required the function of phospholipase Cbeta
      (PLCbeta). Whereas intracellular Ca(2+) release and protein kinase C activity
      were unnecessary, PLCbeta-induced depletion of phosphatidylinositol
      4,5-bisphosphate was involved in AVP-evoked excitation of the DG GCs. AVP excited
      the DG GCs by depression of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, which were required 
      for AVP-elicited facilitation of long-term potentiation at the perforant path-GC 
      synapses. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to explain
      the physiological functions of AVP, such as learning and memory, and pathologic
      disorders like anxiety.

TI  - Metal-Doped Al12N12X (X = Na, Mg, K) Nanoclusters as Nanosensors for Carboplatin:
      Insight from First-Principles Computation.
PG  - 5066-5080
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c03671 [doi]
AB  - This theoretical study focuses on the adsorption, reactivity, topological
      analysis, and sensing behavior of metal-doped (K, Na, and Mg) aluminum nitride
      (Al12N12) nanoclusters using the first-principle density functional theory (DFT).
      All quantum chemical reactivity, natural bond orbital (NBO), free energies
      (DeltaG, DeltaH), and sensor parameters were investigated using the omegaB97XD
      functional with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The trapping of carboplatin (cbp)
      onto the surfaces of doped Al12N12 was studied using four functionals PBE0-D3,
      M062X-D3, omegaB97XD, and B3LYP-D3 at the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Overall, the
      substantial change in the energy gap of the surfaces after the adsorption process
      affects the work function, field emission, and the electrical conductivity of the
      doped clusters, hence making the studied surfaces a better sensor material for
      detecting carboplatin. Higher free energies of solvation were obtained in polar
      solvents compared to nonpolar solvents. Moreover, negative solvation energies and
      adsorption energies were obtained, which therefore shows that the engineered
      surfaces are highly efficient in trapping carboplatin. The relatively strong
      adsorption energies show that the mechanism of adsorption is by chemisorption,
      and K- and Na-doped metal clusters acted as better sensors for carboplatin. Also,
      the topological analysis in comparison to previous studies shows that the
      nanoclusters exhibited very high stability with regard to their relevant binding 
      energies and hydrogen bond interactions.

TI  - Overexpression of efflux pumps AcrAB and OqxAB contributes to ciprofloxacin
      resistance in clinical isolates of K. pneumonia.
LID - 10.2174/1389203723666220630162920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae is regarded as 
      a severe public health concern worldwide, with most countries reporting an
      increase in fatality rates over time. Efflux pumps are significant determinants
      of acquired and/or intrinsic resistance in K. pneumoniae. OBJECTIVES: Our aim is 
      to explore efflux-mediated resistance mechanisms in K. pneumoniae by using
      quantitative real-time PCR in order to evaluate the expression of efflux pump
      genes (acrA, acrB, oqxA, and oqxB) and pump regulators (marA, soxS, and rarA).
      METHOD: Efflux pump inhibitor CCCP was able to a reduce MIC values of
      ciprofloxacin by 2 to 64-fold in 43/46 (93%) of MDR-K. pneumoniae isolates.
      RESULTS: Compared to the control strain (untreated one), our results demonstrated
      that acrA, acrB, oqxA, oqxB, marA, soxS, and rarA were overexpressed in 29 (63%),
      24 (52%), 29 (63%), 24 (52%), 17 (37%), 16 (35%), and 16 (35%) of K. pneumoniae
      isolates, respectively. Additionally, a positive correlation was established
      between the expressions of acrAB and marA (r = 0.50, r = 0.45, respectively) and 
      oqxAB and rarA (r = 0.462912, r = 0.519354, respectively). CONCLUSION:
      Ciprofloxacin resistance was caused by overexpression of the efflux pump genes
      acrAB and oqxAB, as well as the transcriptional regulators marA, soxS, and rarA
      in clinical isolates of K. pneumonia.

TI  - Validating and Comparing C-TIRADS, K-TIRADS and ACR-TIRADS in Stratifying the
      Malignancy Risk of Thyroid Nodules.
PG  - 899575
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.899575 [doi]
AB  - The thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) was proposed by experts
      for optimal ultrasound evaluation of malignancy risk of thyroid focal lesions.
      There are several versions of TIRADS, some of them have been validated
      sufficiently, and the others have not been well assessed. In this study, a
      recently launched Chinese version of TIRADS (C-TIRADS) for malignancy risk
      stratification of thyroid nodules was validated, and the performance was compared
      to that of the Korean TIRADS (K-TIRADS) and American College of Radiology(ACR)
      TIRADS (ACR-TIRADS). Archives of 2177 patients who had undergone thyroid
      ultrasound examination, coarse needle tissue biopsy and/or surgery were reviewed,
      and 1978 patients with 1982 thyroid nodules were assessed according to the three 
      TIRADSs. The histopathology was taken as the golden standard. The results showed 
      the 1982 thyroid nodules were consisted of 1306 benign nodules and 676 malignant 
      nodules. The malignancy risk accounted for 1.09%, 2.14%, 10.34%, 49.28%, 88.19%
      and 85.29% of the total nodules that were categorised as C-TIRADS 2, 3, 4A, 4B,
      4C and 5, respectively; 0.00%, 1.64%, 2.87%,18.71% and 82.22% of the total
      nodules that were categorised as ACR-TIRADS 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively;
      0.85%, 3.27%, 24.27% and 80.96% of the total nodules that were categorised as
      K-TIRADS 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The correlation between the category of
      TIRADS and percentile of malignancy was 0.94 in the C-TIRADS, 1.00 in the
      ACR-TIRADS, and 1.00 in the K-TIRADS, respectively. The highest values of
      accuracy(AUC) of ROC curves of C-TIRADS 4B, K-TIRADS 5 and ACR-TIRADS 5 were
      taken as the cut-off values for risk stratification, respectively. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and AUC by
      C-TIRADS 4B, K-TIRADS 5 and ACR-TIRADS 5 for malignancy risk stratification of
      thyroid nodules were 90.83%, 84.23%, 74.88% and 94.66% and 0.88, respectively;
      83.58%, 89.82%, 80.95%, 91.36% and 0.87, respectively; and 85.50%, 90.35%,
      82.10%, 92.33% and 0.88, respectively (P>0.05 for all). We concluded that the
      C-TIRADS has excellent performance in the malignancy risk stratification of
      thyroid nodules by the optimized cut-off value, which is comparable to that in
      K-TIRADS and ACR-TIRADS.

TI  - Determinants of Behavioral Intention and Use of Interactive Whiteboard by K-12
      Teachers in Remote and Rural Areas.
PG  - 934423
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.934423 [doi]
AB  - Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) has recently been used to replace the TWB
      (traditional whiteboard), with many of its features being observed to help
      teachers in educational activities. This is based on effectively and efficiently 
      increasing the teacher-student interaction. Therefore, this study aims to analyze
      the determinants of Behavioral Intention (BI) and the use of interactive
      whiteboards by K-12 teachers, in remote and rural Chinese areas. The
      Modified-Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model was 
      used in this analysis, as a learning medium to deliver the subject matter to
      students. The sample and population were also the teachers in the Guangxi Zhuang 
      Autonomous Region, China, where 171 voluntary respondents participated in this
      study. Furthermore, the obtained data were processed using a Structural Equation 
      Model (SEM) approach, through the Smart-PLS software. The results showed that
      Habit and Hedonic Motivation had a significant influence on the Behavioral
      Intention (BI) of teachers, toward the utilization of IWB in remote and rural
      areas. Besides this, Facilitating Conditions (FCs) and BI also had a significant 
      positive effect on Usage Behavior. Based on these results, important information 
      was provided to school principals, local governments, and teachers for education 
      quality improvement, regarding the patterns of increasing IWB utilization in
      remote and rural areas.

      arthritis synovial fibroblasts.
LID - 10.29219/fnr.v66.8645 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antcin K, an extract of Antrodia cinnamomea (a medicinal mushroom
      endemic to Taiwan commonly used in Chinese medicine preparations), inhibits
      proinflammatory cytokine production and angiogenesis in human rheumatoid
      arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), major players in RA disease. Antcin K
      also inhibits disease activity in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Up 
      until now, the effects of Antcin K upon cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were
      unknown. Methods: RA and healthy synovial tissue samples (n = 10 in each group)
      were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession code:
      GDS5401) to compare CAM and monocyte marker expressions. In addition, synovial
      tissue samples from six RA patients and six patients undergoing arthroscopy for
      trauma/joint derangement (healthy controls) were subjected to immunohistochemical
      (IHC) analysis. mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed in RASFs using
      RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and
      Western blot. RASFs were incubated with Antcin K and examined for monocyte
      adherence by fluorescence microscopy. Ankle joint tissue specimens from a CIA
      mouse model and healthy controls were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
      and Safranin-O/Fast Green to examine histological changes and evidence of bone
      loss. IHC analysis determined levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
      (VCAM-1) and CD11b in CIA ankle tissue and clinical synovial tissue. Results:
      Levels of VCAM-1 expression were higher in the GEO database specimens and the
      study's clinical samples of RA synovial tissue compared with the healthy
      specimens. Antcin K dose-dependently inhibited VCAM-1 expression and monocyte
      adhesion in RASFs. Antcin K also significantly inhibited levels of VCAM-1 and
      monocyte CD11b expression in CIA tissue. These effects appeared to be mediated by
      MEK1/2-ERK, p38, and AP-1 signaling. Conclusions: Antcin K seems promising for
      the treatment of RA and deserves further investigations.

TI  - A Pan-Cancer Analysis Revealing the Dual Roles of Lysine (K)-Specific Demethylase
      6B in Tumorigenesis and Immunity.
PG  - 912003
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.912003 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Epigenetic-targeted therapy has been increasingly applied in the
      treatment of cancers. Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) is an epigenetic
      enzyme involved in the coordinated control between cellular intrinsic regulators 
      and the tissue microenvironment whereas the pan-cancer analysis of KDM6B remains 
      unavailable. Methods: The dual role of KDM6B in 33 cancers was investigated based
      on the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)
      databases. TIMER2 and GEPIA2 were applied to investigate the KDM6B levels in
      different subtypes or stages of tumors. Besides, the Human Protein Atlas database
      allowed us to conduct a pan-cancer study of the KDM6B protein levels. GEPIA2 and 
      Kaplan-Meier plotter were used for the prognosis analysis in different cancers.
      Characterization of genetic modifications of the KDM6B gene was analyzed by the
      cBioPortal. DNA methylation levels of different KDM6B probes in different TCGA
      tumors were analyzed by MEXPRESS. TIMER2 was applied to determine the association
      of the KDM6B expression and immune infiltration and DNA methyltransferases.
      Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the association of the KDM6B
      expression with TMB (tumor mutation burden) and MSI (microsatellite instability).
      The KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathway analysis and GO (Gene 
      ontology) enrichment analysis were used to further investigate the potential
      mechanism of KDM6B in tumor pathophysiology. Results: KDM6B was downregulated in 
      11 cancer types and upregulated across five types. In KIRC (kidney renal clear
      cell carcinoma) and OV (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma), the KDM6B level was
      significantly associated with the pathological stage. A high level of KDM6B was
      related to poor OS (overall survival) outcomes for THCA (thyroid carcinoma),
      while a low level was correlated with poor OS and DFS (disease-free survival)
      prognosis of KIRC. The KDM6B expression level was associated with TMB, MSI, and
      immune cell infiltration, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts, across
      various cancer types with different correlations. Furthermore, the enrichment
      analysis revealed the relationship between H3K4 and H3K27 methylation and KDM6B
      function. Conclusion: Dysregulation of the DNA methyltransferase activity and
      methylation levels of H3K4 and H3K27 may involve in the dual role of KDM6B in
      tumorigenesis and development. Our study offered a relatively comprehensive
      understanding of KDM6B's dual role in cancer development and response to
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Cannulated Screws versus Ring Pin versus K-Wire with Tension
      Band Fixation Techniques in the Treatment of Transverse Patellar Fractures: A
      Case-Control Study with Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up.
PG  - 5610627
LID - 10.1155/2022/5610627 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: K-wire with tension band (KTB) technique has long been the primary
      surgical method for transverse patella fractures; however, it also has
      shortcomings. This study is aimed at evaluating the three different techniques to
      see whether the cannulated screw tension band (CSTB) or ring pin tension band
      (RPTB) techniques could decrease complications and achieve better knee function
      compared with KTB. Methods: We conducted a retrospective comparison of the KTB,
      CSTB, and RPTB fixation techniques. We selected and reviewed 90 patients (30
      patients in each fixation group) with follow-up at least 2 years. Duration of
      operation, intraoperative blood loss, mean healing time, visual analog scale
      score, range of motion, Bostman score, Iowa knee score, modified Lysholm rating
      scale, and postoperative complications were compared. Multivariate analyses were 
      performed to identify the independent risk factors for fracture healing time,
      postoperative complications, and knee function recovery. Results: After adjusting
      for confounding factors, multivariate regression analysis revealed that CSTB was 
      0.26 times (95% CI: 0.08-0.86, p = 0.027) less likely to prolong fracture healing
      time, 0.20 times (95% CI: 0.06-0.64, p = 0.007) lesser risk of postoperative
      complications, and more than four times (95% CI: 1.41-13.56, p = 0.011) as likely
      to improve the knee function score compared with KTB. Besides, RPTB were also
      superior to KTB in reducing the incidence of postoperative complications (OR:
      0.21, 95% CI: 0.07-0.64, p = 0.006) and improved knee function score (OR: 3.96,
      95% CI: 1.30-12.08, p = 0.016); however, the CSTB group being more superior. In
      addition, AO/OTA C2 fractures (OR, odds ratio: 10.68, 95% CI: 1.30-87.70, p =
      0.027) and high-energy fracture (OR: 8.78, 95% CI: 1.57-49.17, p = 0.013) were
      also associated with prolonged fracture healing time but not with postoperative
      complications and knee function. No significant differences in related indicators
      such as gender, age, BMI, AO/OTA classification, fracture side, injury mechanism,
      duration of operation, and intraoperative blood loss were detected among the
      three groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the CSTB technique is
      superior to KTB and RPTB techniques in reducing the incidence of postoperative
      complications, and it also has advantages in accelerating fracture healing,
      achieving better VAS, ROM, and functional recovery. Further long-term large-sized
      prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the KTB in
      treating transverse patellar fractures.

TI  - The Importance of Mg2+-free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K-Ras
      Mutants.
LID - 10.1002/chem.202201449 [doi]
AB  - For efficient targeting of oncogenic K-Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic
      picture of the Ras-cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques 
      and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in
      wild-type and three oncogenic P-loop mutants of K-Ras. Our measurements reveal a 
      dominant two-state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP- and
      GTP-bound K-Ras. The identified low-populated higher energy state in GDP-loaded
      K-Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide-bound/Mg 2+ -free state
      characterized by shortened beta2/beta3-strands and a partially released switch-I 
      region preparing K-Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange 
      factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation-specific
      differences in K-Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our
      understanding of prolonged K-Ras signaling and may aid the development of
      allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K-Ras.

AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) should be the preferred
      anticoagulant strategy for preventing ischemic stroke in patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF) at increased thromboembolic risk and for treating deep venous
      thromboembolism (DVT) in the general population. Beyond their inhibiting action
      on the activated factor X (FXa) or thrombin (FIIa), NOACs showed some pleiotropic
      anti-inflammatory effects. The present review aimed to describe the role of FXa
      and FIIa in the inflammation pathway and the potential anti-inflammatory effects 
      of NOACs.

AB  - Salmonella (S.) enterica subspecies diarizonae (IIIb) serovar 61:k:1,5,(7) (S.
      IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7)) is considered to be sheep-associated, as it can be found in
      the intestine, tonsils and nose of clinically healthy sheep, but it has also been
      described in separate clinical disorders in sheep. In particular, S. IIIb
      61:k:1,5,(7) is described as the causative agent of chronic proliferative
      rhinitis (CPR) in sheep. In Switzerland, CPR in sheep due to S. IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7)
      was first described in 2017 in a flock of Texel sheep. Therefore, we assessed the
      prevalence of S. IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7) within the Swiss sheep population using a
      representative sampling strategy. From May 2017 to June 2018 a total of 681 nasal
      swabs from individual clinically healthy sheep of 141 different flocks throughout
      Switzerland were taken. Swabs were analysed by selective enrichment for the
      presence of S. IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7). Additionally, antimicrobial resistance of the
      isolates was determined by broth microdilution. A total of 146 out of 681 nasal
      swabs tested positive for S. IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7), which corresponds to a prevalence
      on animal level of 21% (95%CI 18%-25%). In 73 out of 141 flocks tested, at least 
      one sheep tested positive for S. IIIb 61:k:1.5,(7), resulting in a minimal
      prevalence on flock level of 52% (95%CI 43%-60%). Positive flocks were found in
      all cantons except the canton of Jura. Adults were significantly more affected
      than sheep under one year/lambs and positive sheep were found in several breeds. 
      No microbiologically resistant isolates were detected, except for one isolate
      showing resistance against ampicillin. Because of its widespread occurrence in
      the Swiss sheep population, further research should focus on the pathogenic
      impact of S. IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7) on the health status of sheep.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
      bacterium (ESBL-KP). Recently, K. quasipneumoniae and K. variicola were
      reclassified from K. pneumoniae based on genome sequencing. However, the
      molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of
      ESBL-producing K. quasipneumoniae (ESBL-KQ) and ESBL-producing K. variicola
      (ESBL-KV) remain unclear. Here, we aimed to distinguish ESBL-KQ and ESBL-KV from 
      ESBL-KP in terms of frequency, genomic characteristics, and antimicrobial
      susceptibility patterns. Of the 74 ESBL-KP isolates, 12 (16.2%) were reclassified
      as ESBL-KQ and 1 (1.4%) as ESBL-KV. Patients with ESBL-KP and ESBL-KQ infections 
      were of similar age; ESBL-KQ infection was more frequent in men.
      Infection-associated mortality seemed to be similar in patients with ESBL-KQ and 
      ESBL-KP infections, without a statistically significant difference (p = 0.99).
      Genetic analysis revealed that 19.1% of ESBL-producing Klebsiella isolates
      harbored AmpC. The prevalence of AmpC was higher with ESBL-KP (31.1%) than with
      ESBL-KQ (8.3%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p =
      0.52). The frequency of ESBL-KQ with AmpC and quinolone-resistance-associated
      genes in clinical samples increased annually (p = 0.04). The prevalence of
      Klebsiella with fluoroquinolone-resistance genes did not differ significantly
      between species (p > 0.99). The gene profiles of ESBL-KQ and ESBL-KP differed,
      and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance via AmpC and
      fluoroquinolone-resistance genes increased. Further studies are required to
      distinguish ESBL-KP and ESBL-KQ and determine the mechanism underlying the spread
      of AmpC and quinolone-resistance genes to prevent further spread of these genes.

AB  - A previous acute toxicity study of binary mixtures showed that the combined
      toxicity can be predicted with the parameter kECx. To systematically investigate 
      the ability of kECx to predict the chronic combined toxicity of binary mixtures, 
      the toxicity of six contaminants and five binary mixtures was determined by
      long-term microplate toxicity analysis (L-MTA) using Aliivibrio fischeri as the
      test organism. The independent action model (IA) and the relative model deviation
      ratio (rMDR) were employed to determine the relationship between the Delta(kECx)%
      and rMDRx. The results showed that these two factors conformed to the exponential
      function in long-term toxicity. Owing to the time-dependence of toxicity, the
      mixture type of chronic toxicity changes to the relative type of acute toxicity. 
      If the acute toxicity of binary mixtures changes their mode of joint action
      throughout the concentration range, the chronic toxicity will also change their
      mode of joint action, and vice versa. This study clarified the change rules of
      the joint action of binary mixtures in acute and chronic toxicity which can
      promote research on chronic toxicity of binary mixtures.

TI  - Identification of the high-yield monacolin K strain from Monascus spp. and its
      submerged fermentation using different medicinal plants.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s40529-022-00351-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical plants confer various benefits to human health and their
      bioconversion through microbial fermentation can increase efficacy, reduce
      toxicity, conserve resources and produce new chemical components. In this study, 
      the cholesterol-lowering monacolin K genes and content produced by Monascus
      species were identified. The high-yield monacolin K strain further fermented with
      various medicinal plants. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, red
      pigment and monacolin K content, total phenolic content, and metabolites in the
      fermented products were analyzed. RESULTS: Monacolin K was detected in Monascus
      pilosus (BCRC 38072), and Monascus ruber (BCRC 31533, 31523, 31534, 31535, and
      33323). It responded to the highly homologous mokA and mokE genes encoding
      polyketide synthase and dehydrogenase. The high-yield monacolin K strain, M.
      ruber BCRC 31535, was used for fermentation with various medicinal plants. A
      positive relationship between the antioxidant capacity and total phenol content
      of the fermented products was observed after 60 days of fermentation, and both
      declined after 120 days of fermentation. By contrast, red pigment and monacolin K
      accumulated over time during fermentation, and the highest monacolin K content
      was observed in the fermentation of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, as confirmed by
      RT-qPCR. Moreover, Monascus-fermented medicinal plants including Paeonia
      lactiflora, Alpinia oxyphylla, G. uralensis, and rice were not cytotoxic. Only
      the product of Monascus-fermented G. uralensis significantly exhibited the
      anti-inflammatory capacity in a dose-dependent manner in
      lipopolysaccharide-induced Raw264.7 cells. The metabolites of G. uralensis with
      and without fermentation (60 days) were compared by LC/MS. 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic
      acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, and 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate were considered to
      enhance the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ability. CONCLUSIONS: Given that
      highly homologous monacolin K and citrinin genes can be observed in Monascus
      spp., monacolin K produced by Monascus species without citrinin genes can be
      detected through the complementary methods of PCR and HPLC. In addition, the
      optimal fermentation time was important to the acquisition of antioxidants, red
      pigment and monacolin K. These bioactive substances were significantly affected
      by medicinal plants over fermentation time. Consequently, Monascus-fermented G.
      uralensis had a broad spectrum of biological activities.

AB  - Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a disorder characterized by pruritus and
      elevated liver function tests and bile acids. Poor vitamin absorption and, as a
      result, hypovitaminosis K can occur as a result of the pathology. Given the known
      effects of vitamin K, the authors considered that hypovitaminosis K could
      increase the risk of coagulopathic hemorrhage in pregnant women. The study
      revealed that 59.2% of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy were
      diagnosed with hypovitaminosis K; however, 98.6% of women had normal coagulogram 
      indices. Thus, coagulogram markers are more likely to indicate vitamin K activity
      than its actual level.

TI  - Compression rate of dynamic diamond anvil cells from room temperature to 10 K.
PG  - 063901
LID - 10.1063/5.0091102 [doi]
AB  - There is an ever increasing interest in studying dynamic-pressure dependent
      phenomena utilizing dynamic Diamond Anvil Cells (dDACs), devices capable of a
      highly controlled rate of compression. Here, we characterize and compare the
      compression rate of dDACs in which the compression is actuated via three
      different methods: (1) stepper motor (S-dDAC), (2) gas membrane (M-dDAC), and (3)
      piezoactuator (P-dDAC). The compression rates of these different types of dDAC
      were determined solely on millisecond time-resolved R1-line fluorescence of a
      ruby sphere located within the sample chamber. Furthermore, these different
      dynamic compression-techniques have been described and characterized over a broad
      temperature and pressure range from 10 to 300 K and 0-50 GPa. At room
      temperature, piezoactuation (P-dDAC) has a clear advantage in controlled
      extremely fast compression, having recorded a compression rate of approximately 7
      TPa/s, which is also found to be primarily influenced by the charging time of the
      piezostack. At 40-250 K, gas membranes (M-dDAC) have also been found to generate 
      rapid compression of approximately 0.5-3 TPa/s and are readily interfaced with
      moderate cryogenic and ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Approaching more extreme
      cryogenic conditions (<10 K), a stepper motor driven lever arm (S-dDAC) offers a 
      solution for high-precision moderate compression rates in a regime where P-dDACs 
      and M-dDACs can become difficult to incorporate. The results of this paper
      demonstrate the applicability of different dynamic compression techniques, and
      when applied, they can offer us new insights into matter's response to strain,
      which is highly relevant to physics, geoscience, and chemistry.

TI  - Cardiac glycoside-mediated turnover of Na, K-ATPases as a rational approach to
      reducing cell surface levels of the cellular prion protein.
PG  - e0270915
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270915 [doi]
AB  - It is widely anticipated that a reduction of brain levels of the cellular prion
      protein (PrPC) can prolong survival in a group of neurodegenerative diseases
      known as prion diseases. To date, efforts to decrease steady-state PrPC levels by
      targeting this protein directly with small molecule drug-like compounds have
      largely been unsuccessful. Recently, we reported Na,K-ATPases to reside in
      immediate proximity to PrPC in the brain, unlocking an opportunity for an
      indirect PrPC targeting approach that capitalizes on the availability of potent
      cardiac glycosides (CGs). Here, we report that exposure of human co-cultures of
      neurons and astrocytes to non-toxic nanomolar levels of CGs causes profound
      reductions in PrPC levels. The mechanism of action underpinning this outcome
      relies primarily on a subset of CGs engaging the ATP1A1 isoform, one of three
      alpha subunits of Na,K-ATPases expressed in brain cells. Upon CG docking to
      ATP1A1, the ligand receptor complex, and PrPC along with it, is internalized by
      the cell. Subsequently, PrPC is channeled to the lysosomal compartment where it
      is digested in a manner that can be rescued by silencing the cysteine protease
      cathepsin B. These data signify that the repurposing of CGs may be beneficial for
      the treatment of prion disorders.

AB  - This research was to evaluate the effects of regular hemodialysis (HD) on the
      brain function of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Resting-state
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) based on improved k-means
      clustering algorithm (k-means) was proposed to scan the brains of 30 regular
      dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (experimental group) and 30
      normal volunteers (control group). The proposed algorithm was compared with the
      traditional k-means algorithm and mean shift algorithm and applied to the
      magnetic resonance scan of patients with ESRD on long-term regular HD. The
      results showed that the neuropsychological cognitive function (NSCF) evaluation
      result of the test group was much better than that of the control group, and the 
      difference was statistically obvious (P < 0.05). The results of blood
      biochemistry, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment Scale (MoCA) in the test group showed no statistical difference
      compared with those in the control group. The running time of the improved
      k-means algorithm was dramatically shorter than that of traditional k-means
      algorithm, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05). Comparison among the
      improved and traditional k-means algorithm and mean shift algorithm suggested
      that the improved k-means algorithm showed a lower error rate for image
      segmentation, and the differences were statistically remarkable (P < 0.05). In
      conclusion, the improved k-means algorithm showed better time efficiency and the 
      lowest error rate in processing rs-fMRI images than the traditional k-means
      algorithm and mean shift algorithm, and the effects of regular HD on the brains
      of patients with ESRD were evaluated effectively.

TI  - Diagnostic validity of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, second edition
      (K-ADOS-2) in the Korean population.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/s13229-022-00506-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Korean version of the Autism Diagnostic Observation
      Schedule-2 (K-ADOS-2) is widely being used to diagnose autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) in South Korea, no previous study has examined the validity and reliability
      of all modules of K-ADOS-2 across a wide age range, particularly older children, 
      adolescents, and adults. METHOD: Data from 2,158 participants were included (mean
      age = 79.7 months; 73.6% male): 1473 participants with ASD and 685 participants
      without ASD (Toddler Module, n = 289; Module 1, n = 642; Module 2 n = 574; Module
      3 n = 411; Module 4, n = 242). Participants completed a battery of tests,
      including the K-ADOS or K-ADOS-2 and other existing diagnostic instruments.
      Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Cohen's 
      kappa (k), and agreement with existing diagnostic instruments were computed.
      Cronbach's alpha values were also calculated. RESULTS: All developmental cells of
      the K-ADOS-2 showed sufficient ranges of sensitivity 85.4-100.0%; specificity,
      80.4-96.8%; area under the ROC curve, .90-.97; PPV, 77.8-99.3%; NPV, 80.6-100.0%;
      and k values, .83-.92. The kappa agreements of developmental cells with existing 
      diagnostic instruments ranged from .20 to .90. Cronbach's alpha values ranged
      from .82 to .91 across all developmental cells. LIMITATION: The best-estimate
      clinical diagnoses made in this study were not independent of the K-ADOS-2
      scores. Some modules did not include balanced numbers of participants in terms of
      gender and diagnostic status. CONCLUSION: The K-ADOS-2 is a valid and reliable
      instrument in diagnosing ASD in South Korea. Future studies exploring the
      effectiveness of the K-ADOS-2 in capturing restricted, repetitive behaviors and
      differentiating ASD from other developmental disabilities are needed.

TI  - Weighted Zernike defocus coefficient of treatment zone is a meaningful indicator 
      for myopia control efficacy of Ortho-K lenses.

LID - 10.1186/s40662-022-00296-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to reproduce a three-dimensional
      representation of corneal defocus characteristics after orthokeratology (Ortho-K)
      treatment via an indicator defined as the weighted Zernike defocus coefficient of
      the treatment zone (Cweighted defocus). This could be used to predict the
      effectiveness of Ortho-K treatment quantitatively in a timely manner after the
      one-month visit. METHODS: Seventy myopic children with axial length (AL)
      elongation after Ortho-K treatment (group A) and 63 myopic children with AL
      shortening after Ortho-K treatment (group B) were included in this one-year
      retrospective study. The proposed indicator was calculated by a customized MATLAB
      program. Multivariate binomial logistic regression and multivariate linear
      regression analyses were used to explore the association between AL change and
      the Cweighted defocus, age, sex, and other ocular biometric parameters. RESULTS: 
      The 12-month AL change, age, pupil diameter, and vertical decentration of the
      Ortho-K lens were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate
      logistic regression analysis showed that a larger Cweighted defocus (>/= 0.35
      D/mm(2)) (OR: 0.224; 95% CI: 0.078-0.646; P = 0.006) was correlated with the
      emergence of AL shortening after orthokeratology treatment. A multivariate linear
      regression model showed that a greater Cweighted defocus was associated with
      slower 12-month AL elongation (beta = - 0.51, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
      Cweighted defocus is an effective predictive indicator of myopia control, and a
      larger Cweighted defocus may lead to slower elongation of AL. This meaningful
      indicator may help in the evaluation and adjustment of Ortho-K lens parameters in
      a timely manner and minimize the cost of clinical trial and error.

TI  - Human endogenous retrovirus-K (HERV-K) reverse transcriptase (RT) structure and
      biochemistry reveals remarkable similarities to HIV-1 RT and opportunities for
      HERV-K-specific inhibition.
PG  - e2200260119

AB  - Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) comprise nearly 8% of the human genome and 
      are derived from ancient integrations of retroviruses into the germline. The
      biology of HERVs is poorly defined, but there is accumulating evidence supporting
      pathological roles in diverse diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune, and
      neurodegenerative diseases. Functional proteins are produced by HERV-encoded
      genes, including reverse transcriptases (RTs), which could be a contributor to
      the pathology attributed to aberrant HERV-K expression. To facilitate the
      discovery and development of HERV-K RT potent and selective inhibitors, we
      expressed active HERV-K RT and determined the crystal structure of a ternary
      complex of this enzyme with a double-stranded DNA substrate. We demonstrate a
      range of RT inhibition with antiretroviral nucleotide analogs, while classic
      nonnucleoside analogs do not inhibit HERV-K RT. Detailed comparisons of HERV-K RT
      with other known RTs demonstrate similarities to diverse RT families and a
      striking similarity to the HIV-1 RT asymmetric heterodimer. Our analysis further 
      reveals opportunities for selective HERV-K RT inhibition.

TI  - The Self-Bleaching Process of Microcystis aeruginosa is Delayed by a Symbiotic
      Bacterium Pseudomonas sp. MAE1-K and Promoted by Methionine Deficiency.
PG  - e0181422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01814-22 [doi]
AB  - Various interactions between marine cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria have
      been known, but the symbiotic relationships between Microcystis and heterotrophic
      bacteria remain unclear. An axenic M. aeruginosa culture (NIES-298) was quickly
      bleached after exponential growth, whereas a xenic M. aeruginosa culture (KW)
      showed a normal growth curve, suggesting that some symbiotic bacteria may delay
      this bleaching. The bleaching process of M. aeruginosa was distinguished from the
      phenomena of previously proposed chlorosis and programmed cell death in various
      characteristics. Bleached cultures of NIES-298 quickly bleached actively growing 
      M. aeruginosa cultures, suggesting that M. aeruginosa itself produces
      bleach-causing compounds. Pseudomonas sp. MAE1-K delaying the bleaching of
      NIES-298 cultures was isolated from the KW culture. Bleached cultures of NIES-298
      treated with strain MAE1-K lost their bleaching ability, suggesting that strain
      MAE1-K rescues M. aeruginosa from bleaching via inactivation of bleaching
      compounds. From Tn5 transposon mutant screening, a metZ mutant of strain MAE1-K
      (F-D3) unable to synthesize methionine, promoting the bleaching of NIES-298
      cultures but capable of inactivating bleaching compounds, was obtained. The
      bleaching process of NIES-298 cultures was promoted with the coculture of mutant 
      F-D3 and delayed by methionine supplementation, suggesting that the bleaching
      process of M. aeruginosa is promoted by methionine deficiency. IMPORTANCE
      Cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters represent serious global concerns for the
      ecosystem and human health. In this study, we found that one of the major species
      in cyanobacterial blooms, Microcystis aeruginosa, was quickly collapsed after
      exponential growth by producing self-bleaching compounds and that a symbiotic
      bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. MAE1-K delayed the bleaching process via the
      inactivation of bleaching compounds. In addition, we found that a metZ mutant of 
      strain MAE1-K (F-D3) causing methionine deficiency promoted the bleaching process
      of M. aeruginosa, suggesting that methionine deficiency may induce the production
      of bleaching compounds. These results will provide insights into the symbiotic
      relationships between M. aeruginosa and heterotrophic bacteria that will
      contribute to developing novel strategies to control cyanobacterial blooms.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection via Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence
      or Antagonist II, Alpha-Fetoprotein, and D-Dimer in Hepatitis B Virus-Related
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to explore the clinical diagnostic value of combined detection 
      via protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II),
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and D-dimer (D-D) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: We analyzed PIVKA-II, AFP,
      and D-D levels in 291 subjects comprising liver cirrhosis (LC) patients (n = 143)
      and HCC patients (n = 148). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
      used to analyze and compare the clinical diagnostic value of the three biomarkers
      for HBV-related HCC alone and in combination. Results: The levels of PIVKA-II,
      AFP, and D-D were positively correlated with tumor size in HCC patients. The
      levels of PIVKA-II and AFP in early-stage HCC, advanced HCC, HBV DNA+ HCC, and
      HBV DNA- HCC patients were higher than those in LC patients, while the levels of 
      D-D were lower. The area under the curve for combined detection was greater than 
      that for single-index detection in early-stage HCC, advanced HCC, HBV DNA+ HCC,
      and HBV DNA- HCC patients. Conclusion: D-D may be a useful biomarker for the
      diagnosis of HBV-related HCC. The combined detection of PIVKA-II, AFP, and D-D
      had better diagnostic value for different types of HCC than the detection of
      individual biomarkers.

TI  - The development of cigarette smoke induced chronic pancreatitis in mice is
      associated with increased expression of K-Ras and NF-kappaB.
PG  - 246-251

LID - 10.26444/aaem/144600 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong
      association between cigarette smoking (CS) and chronic pancreatitis (CP);
      however, the exact mechanisms of this phenomenon remains unknown. The authors
      have previously shown that increased Ras expression activates the NF-kappaB
      mediated pathway and promotes development of CP. However, it is unclear whether a
      similar phenomenon occurs in CS-induced CP. Therefore, the aim of the study was
      to determine whether CS increases the expression of K-Ras, and promotes the
      development of CP in mice exposed to repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis
      (AP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: C57BL6/cmdb mice were exposed to CS or a sham
      treatment for 12 weeks. After one week of exposure, half of the animals from both
      groups were additionally subjected to repeated cerulein treatment (once a week,
      for 10 consecutive weeks) to mimic recurrent episodes of AP. Extension of
      pancreatic damage was determined histologically by H&E and Trichrome staining.
      The expression of K-Ras protein and downstream components (NF-kappaB, Cox-2,
      TGF-beta) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C57BL6/cmdb mice
      exposed to CS or cerulein alone did not develop any chronic pancreatic damage.
      However, concomitant treatment with both of these agents caused focal acinar
      atrophy, with slight intralobular and perivascular areas of fibrosis, and
      inflammatory cells infiltration resembling mild CP. Moreover,
      immunohistochemistry examinations revealed increased pancreatic expression of
      K-Ras and NF-kappaB only in mice treated both with CS and cerulein. CONCLUSIONS: 
      CS promotes development of CP in mice exposed to repeated episodes of AP. This
      process may be, at least partially, related to increased expression of K-Ras and 
      NF-kappaB protein.

TI  - Updated S2 K guidelines for the management of bullous pemphigoid initiated by the
      European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV).
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepidermal
      blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes. This disease typically
      affects the elderly and presents with itch and localized or, most frequently,
      generalized bullous lesions. A subset of patients only develops excoriations,
      prurigo-like lesions, and eczematous and/or urticarial erythematous lesions. The 
      disease, which is significantly associated with neurological disorders, has high 
      morbidity and severely impacts the quality of life. OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY:
      The Autoimmune blistering diseases Task Force of the European Academy of
      Dermatology and Venereology sought to update the guidelines for the management of
      BP based on new clinical information, and new evidence on diagnostic tools and
      interventions. The recommendations are either evidence-based or rely on expert
      opinion. The degree of consent among all task force members was included.
      RESULTS: Treatment depends on the severity of BP and patients' comorbidities.
      High-potency topical corticosteroids are recommended as the mainstay of treatment
      whenever possible. Oral prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day is a recommended
      alternative. In case of contraindications or resistance to corticosteroids,
      immunosuppressive therapies, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate
      mofetil or mycophenolate acid, may be recommended. The use of doxycycline and
      dapsone is controversial. They may be recommended, in particular, in patients
      with contraindications to oral corticosteroids. B-cell-depleting therapy and
      intravenous immunoglobulins may be considered in treatment-resistant cases.
      Omalizumab and dupilumab have recently shown promising results. The final version
      of the guideline was consented to by several patient organizations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The guidelines for the management of BP were updated. They summarize evidence-
      and expert-based recommendations useful in clinical practice.

AB  - According to studies carried out, approximately 10 million people developed
      tuberculosis in 2018. Of this total, 1.5 million people died from the disease. To
      study the behavior of the genome sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB),
      the bacterium responsible for the development of tuberculosis (TB), an analysis
      was performed using k-mers (DNA word frequency). The k values ranged from 1 to
      10, because the analysis was performed on the full length of the sequences, where
      each sequence is composed of approximately 4 million base pairs, k values above
      10, the analysis is interrupted, as consequence of the program's capacity. The
      aim of this work was to verify the formation of the phylogenetic tree in each
      k-mer analyzed. The results showed the formation of distinct groups in some
      k-mers analyzed, taking into account the threshold line. However, in all groups, 
      the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains
      remained together and separated from the other strains.

AB  - To investigate the adverse effects of clozapine on cardiovascular ion channels,
      we examined the inhibitory effect of clozapine on voltage-dependent K(+) (Kv)
      channels in rabbit coronary arterial smooth muscle cells. Clozapine-induced
      inhibition of Kv channels occurred in a concentration-dependent manner with an
      half-inhibitory concentration value of 7.84 +/- 4.86 microM and a Hill
      coefficient of 0.47 +/- 0.06. Clozapine did not shift the steady-state activation
      or inactivation curves, suggesting that it inhibited Kv channels regardless of
      gating properties. Application of train pulses (1 and 2 Hz) progressively
      augmented the clozapine-induced inhibition of Kv channels in the presence of the 
      drug. Furthermore, the recovery time constant from inactivation was increased in 
      the presence of clozapine, suggesting that clozapine-induced inhibition of Kv
      channels is use (state)-dependent. Pretreatment of a Kv1.5 subtype inhibitor
      decreased the Kv current amplitudes, but additional application of clozapine did 
      not further inhibit the Kv current. Pretreatment with Kv2.1 or Kv7 subtype
      inhibitors partially blocked the inhibitory effect of clozapine. Based on these
      results, we conclude that clozapine inhibits arterial Kv channels in a
      concentrationand use (state)-dependent manner. Kv1.5 is the major subtype
      involved in clozapine-induced inhibition of Kv channels, and Kv2.1 and Kv7
      subtypes are partially involved.

AB  - Chelating agents are an integral part of transition metal complex chemistry with 
      broad biological and industrial relevance. The hexadentate chelating agent
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has the capability to bind to metal ions
      at its two nitrogen and four of its carboxylate oxygen sites. We use resonant
      inelastic X-ray scattering at the 1s absorption edge of the aforementioned
      elements in EDTA and the iron(III)-EDTA complex to investigate the impact of the 
      metal-ligand bond formation on the electronic structure of EDTA. Frontier orbital
      distortions, occupation changes, and energy shifts through metal-ligand bond
      formation are probed through distinct spectroscopic signatures.

AB  - Gamma-rays from naturally occurring radionuclides are a major component of
      background radiation. They are an important tool for geology and are also
      important for radiation protection. In this paper we use over a quarter of a
      million geochemical measurements of concentrations of potassium, thorium and
      uranium in soils and in stream sediments to estimate outdoor gamma-ray dose rates
      across Great Britain. The soil concentrations are generally at a depth of 5-20 cm
      with some at 35-50 cm. Soil measurements will give spatially relatively precise
      estimates, but as soil data are not available for much of Scotland, stream
      sediment data are used there. Kriging methods are used to estimate surface
      concentrations of K, Th and U and dose rates are imputed from these
      concentrations. Our results are compared with measurement surveys of both outdoor
      and indoor gamma-ray dose rates. Recently there has been interest in exploring
      the carcinogenic risks of low dose radiation by investigating associations
      between childhood cancer rates and doses from natural background gamma radiation.
      To achieve adequate statistical power, such studies must be so large that it is
      impractical to assess exposures by direct measurements in the homes of study
      subjects. Instead the exposures must be modelled. The results presented here will
      be an important input to such work.

TI  - Intracellular Binding of Terfenadine Competes with Its Access to Pancreatic
      ss-cell ATP-Sensitive K(+) Channels and Human ether-a-go-go-Related Gene
      Channels.
LID - 10.1007/s00232-022-00252-y [doi]
AB  - Most blockers of both hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) channels and
      pancreatic ss-cell ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channels access their binding sites 
      from the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. It is unknown whether binding
      to intracellular components competes with binding of these substances to K(+)
      channels. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, a
      laser-scanning confocal microscope, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
      (FCS) were used to study hERG channels expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 
      293 cells and KATP channels from the clonal insulinoma cell line RINm5F. When
      applied via the pipette solution in the whole-cell configuration, terfenadine
      blocked both hERG and KATP currents with much lower potency than after
      application via the bath solution, which was not due to P-glycoprotein-mediated
      efflux of terfenadine. Such a difference was not observed with dofetilide and
      tolbutamide. 37-68% of hERG/EGFP (enhanced green-fluorescent protein) fusion
      proteins expressed in HEK 293 cells were slowly diffusible as determined by
      laser-scanning microscopy in the whole-cell configuration and by FCS in intact
      cells. Bath application of a green-fluorescent sulphonylurea derivative
      (Bodipy-glibenclamide) induced a diffuse fluorescence in the cytosol of RINm5F
      cells under whole-cell patch-clamp conditions. These observations demonstrate the
      presence of intracellular binding sites for hERG and KATP channel blockers not
      dialyzable by the patch-pipette solution. Intracellular binding of terfenadine
      was not influenced by a mutated hERG (Y652A) channel. In conclusion, substances
      with high lipophilicity are not freely diffusible inside the cell but steep
      concentration gradients might exist within the cell and in the sub-membrane
      space.

AB  - In view of the shortcomings of traditional clustering algorithms in feature
      selection and clustering effect, an improved Recency, Frequency, and Money (RFM) 
      model is introduced, and an improved K-medoids algorithm is proposed. Above model
      and algorithm are employed to segment customers of e-commerce. First, traditional
      RFM model is improved by adding two features of customer consumption behavior.
      Second, in order to overcome the defect of setting K value artificially in
      traditional K-medoids algorithm, the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index is introduced
      to determine the optimal number of clustering. Meanwhile, K-medoids algorithm is 
      optimized by changing the selection of centroids to avoid the influence of noise 
      and isolated points. Finally, empirical research is done using a dataset from an 
      e-commerce platform. The results show that our improved K-medoids algorithm can
      improve the efficiency and accuracy of e-commerce customer segmentation.

TI  - Construction of a Few-Layered COF@CNT Composite as an Ultrahigh Rate Cathode for 
      Low-Cost K-Ion Batteries.
PG  - 31234-31244
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c04831 [doi]
AB  - Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are attracting great interest for large-scale
      energy storage owing to the abundant resources and low redox potential of K(+)/K.
      However, the large volume changes and slow kinetics caused by the larger ionic
      radius of K(+) for cathode materials remain a critical challenge for PIBs.
      Herein, we construct few-layered covalent organic frameworks integrated with
      carboxylated carbon nanotubes (DAAQ-COF@CNT) as cathode materials for PIBs. The
      synthesized DAAQ-COF@CNT features numerous active sites, a stable conductive
      framework, and an appropriate surface area with nanopores, which can render high 
      electrical conductivity, shorten the ion/electron diffusion distance, and
      accelerate K(+) diffusion. In consequence, the DAAQ-COF@CNT delivers a high
      reversible capacity of 157.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), an excellent rate
      capability of 111.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and a long cycling stability of 77.6%
      capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The integrated
      characterization of ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform
      infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical simulation discloses that the storage
      mechanism of DAAQ-COF@CNT is based on the reversible reaction between
      electroactive C horizontal lineO groups and K(+) during two successive steps.
      This work provides a promising high-performance cathode material for PIBs and
      encourages the development of new types of covalent organic frameworks for PIBs.

TI  - Inwardly rectifying K(+) channels 4.1 and 5.1 (Kir4.1/Kir5.1) in the renal distal
      nephron.
PG  - C277-C288
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00096.2022 [doi]
AB  - The inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir) 4.1 (encoded by KCNJ10) interacts
      with Kir5.1 (encoded by KCNJ16) to form a major basolateral K(+) channel in the
      renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT), and the cortical
      collecting duct (CCD). Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterotetramer plays an important role in
      regulating Na(+) and K(+) transport in the DCT, CNT, and CCD. A recent
      development in the field has firmly established the role of Kir4.1/Kir5.1
      heterotetramer of the DCT in the regulation of thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl
      cotransporter (NCC). Changes in Kir4.1/Kir5.1 activity of the DCT are an
      essential step for the regulation of NCC expression/activity induced by dietary
      K(+) and Na(+) intakes and play a role in modulating NCC by type 2 angiotensin II
      receptor (AT2R), bradykinin type II receptor (BK2R), and beta-adrenergic
      receptor. Since NCC activity determines the Na(+) delivery rate to the
      aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN), a distal nephron segment from late
      DCT to CCD, Kir4.1/Kir5.1 activity plays a critical role not only in the
      regulation of renal Na(+) absorption but also in modulating renal K(+) excretion 
      and maintaining K(+) homeostasis. Thus, Kir4.1/Kir5.1 activity serves as an
      important component of renal K(+) sensing mechanism. The main focus of this
      review is to provide an overview regarding the role of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 of the
      DCT and CCD in the regulation of renal K(+) excretion and Na(+) absorption.

TI  - LPS-induced impairment of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity: ameliorative effect of
      tannic acid in mice.
PG  - 2133-2140
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-01036-y [doi]
AB  - Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that modulates synaptic
      plasticity and communication, and it is essential for learning and memory
      processes. This neurotransmitter is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
      which plays other cellular roles in processes such as inflammation and oxidative 
      stress. Ion pumps, such as Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase, are highly
      expressed channels that derive energy for their functions from ATP hydrolysis.
      Impairment of the cholinergic system and ion pumps is associated with
      neuropsychiatric diseases. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an example of a
      complex disease with high morbidity and a heterogenous etiology. Polyphenols have
      been investigated for their therapeutic effects, and tannic acid (TA) has been
      reported to show neuroprotective and antidepressant-like activities. Animal
      models of depression-like behavior, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
      models of depression, are useful for investigating the pathophysiology of MDD. In
      this context, effects of TA were evaluated in an LPS-induced mouse model of
      depression-like behavior. Animals received TA for 7 days, and on the last day of 
      treatment, LPS (830 mug/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. In vitro exposure
      of healthy brain to TA decreased the AChE activity. Additionally, this enzyme
      activity was decreased in cerebral cortex of LPS-treated mice. LPS injection
      increased the activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the cerebral cortex but decreased the 
      enzyme activity in the hippocampus. LPS administration decreased
      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum;
      however, TA administration prevented these changes. In conclusion, tannins may
      affect Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities, which is interesting in
      the context of MDD.

TI  - The effect of alcohol packaging size and strength on U.K. alcohol consumers'
      classification of alcohol products as containing a single or multiple drinks.
LID - 10.1037/adb0000860 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reductions to the size and strength of alcohol products prompt
      reductions in alcohol consumption, although these effects may be limited to
      single drinks rather than packages that contain multiple drinks. This study
      investigated what product characteristics predict whether a product is seen as a 
      single drink and seeks to identify the thresholds beyond which products are
      considered to contain multiple drinks. METHOD: Ninety-four U.K. drinkers from the
      prolific participant panel categorized 250 alcohol products with varying
      packaging sizes and strengths into single or multiple drinks. We used multilevel 
      logistic regression to investigate whether packaging size, strength, total
      alcohol content, and container type predicted the likelihood that products were
      classified as a single drink across five drink types (beer, cider,
      ready-to-drink, spirits, wine). We used receiver operating characteristics curve 
      analysis to identify the point at which products become too large or too strong
      to be considered a single drink by most drinkers. RESULTS: Larger products,
      bottled drinks, products with higher alcohol by volume (ABV), and higher alcohol 
      content were more likely to be classified as containing multiple drinks. We
      report thresholds for packaging size, ABV, and total alcohol content where
      products switch from being seen as a single drink to containing multiple drinks. 
      The thresholds did not significantly differ between low-risk and increased risk
      drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: The reported thresholds can help researchers and policy
      makers encourage more accurate self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Future
      research should test whether single drink classifications moderate the effect of 
      packaging size and strength reductions on alcohol consumption. (PsycInfo Database

AB  - MOTIVATION: A dictionary of k-mers is a data structure that stores a set of n
      distinct k-mers and supports membership queries. This data structure is at the
      hearth of many important tasks in computational biology. High-throughput
      sequencing of DNA can produce very large k-mer sets, in the size of billions of
      strings-in such cases, the memory consumption and query efficiency of the data
      structure is a concrete challenge. RESULTS: To tackle this problem, we describe a
      compressed and associative dictionary for k-mers, that is: a data structure where
      strings are represented in compact form and each of them is associated to a
      unique integer identifier in the range [0,n). We show that some statistical
      properties of k-mer minimizers can be exploited by minimal perfect hashing to
      substantially improve the space/time trade-off of the dictionary compared to the 
      best-known solutions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

TI  - CMash: fast, multi-resolution estimation of k-mer-based Jaccard and containment
      indices.
PG  - i28-i35
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac237 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: K-mer-based methods are used ubiquitously in the field of
      computational biology. However, determining the optimal value of k for a specific
      application often remains heuristic. Simply reconstructing a new k-mer set with
      another k-mer size is computationally expensive, especially in metagenomic
      analysis where datasets are large. Here, we introduce a hashing-based technique
      that leverages a kind of bottom-m sketch as well as a k-mer ternary search tree
      (KTST) to obtain k-mer-based similarity estimates for a range of k values. By
      truncating k-mers stored in a pre-built KTST with a large k=kmax value, we can
      simultaneously obtain k-mer-based estimates for all k values up to kmax. This
      truncation approach circumvents the reconstruction of new k-mer sets when
      changing k values, making analysis more time and space-efficient. RESULTS: We
      derived the theoretical expression of the bias factor due to truncation. And we
      showed that the biases are negligible in practice: when using a KTST to estimate 
      the containment index between a RefSeq-based microbial reference database and
      simulated metagenome data for 10 values of k, the running time was close to 10x
      faster compared to a classic MinHash approach while using less than one-fifth the
      space to store the data structure. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A python
      implementation of this method, CMash, is available at
      https://github.com/dkoslicki/CMash. The reproduction of all experiments presented
      herein can be accessed via https://github.com/KoslickiLab/CMASH-reproducibles.

AB  - Diabetes in humans a chronic metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia, 
      it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, disruptions to
      metabolism and vascular functions. It is also linked to oxidative stress and its 
      complications. Its role in vascular dysfunctions is generally reported without
      detailed impact on the molecular mechanisms. Potassium ion channel (K(+)
      channels) are key regulators of vascular tone, and as membrane proteins, are
      modifiable by oxidant stress associated with diabetes. This review manuscript
      examined the impact of oxidant stress on vascular K(+) channel functions in
      diabetes, its implication in vascular complications and metabolic and
      cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast tissue
      and affects about 10% of women at different stages of their lives. In this study,
      we applied a new method to predict recurrence in biological networks made from
      gene expression data. Method: The method includes the steps such as data
      collection, clustering, determining differentiating genes, and classification.
      The eight techniques consist of random forest, support vector machine and neural 
      network, randomforest + k-means, hidden markov model, joint mutual information,
      neural network + k-means and suportvector machine + k-menas were implemented on
      12172 genes and 200 samples. Results: Thirty genes were considered as
      differentiating genes which used for the classification. The results showed that 
      random forest + k-means get better performance than other techniques. The two
      techniques including neural network + k-means and random forest + k-means
      performed better than other techniques in identifying high risk cases.
      Conclusion: Thirty of 12,172 genes are considered for classification that the use
      of clustering has improved the classification techniques performance.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Shaker K(+) Channel Gene Family in Foxtail
      Millet (Setaria italica) and Their Role in Stress Response.
PG  - 907635
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.907635 [doi]
AB  - Potassium (K(+)) is one of the indispensable elements in plant growth and
      development. The Shaker K(+) channel protein family is involved in plant K(+)
      uptake and distribution. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), as an important crop, 
      has strong tolerance and adaptability to abiotic stresses. However, no systematic
      study focused on the Shaker K(+) channel family in foxtail millet. Here, ten
      Shaker K(+) channel genes in foxtail millet were identified and divided into five
      groups through phylogenetic analysis. Gene structures, chromosome locations,
      cis-acting regulatory elements in promoter, and post-translation modification
      sites of Shaker K(+) channels were analyzed. In silico analysis of transcript
      level demonstrated that the expression of Shaker K(+) channel genes was tissue or
      developmental stage specific. The transcription levels of Shaker K(+) channel
      genes in foxtail millet under different abiotic stresses (cold, heat, NaCl, and
      PEG) and phytohormones (6-BA, BR, MJ, IAA, NAA, GA3, SA, and ABA) treatments at
      0, 12, and 24 h were detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that SiAKT1, SiKAT3,
      SiGORK, and SiSKOR were worth further research due to their significant responses
      after most treatments. The yeast complementation assay verified the inward K(+)
      transport activities of detectable Shaker K(+) channels. Finally, we found
      interactions between SiKAT2 and SiSNARE proteins. Compared to research in
      Arabidopsis, our results showed a difference in SYP121 related Shaker K(+)
      channel regulation mechanism in foxtail millet. Our results indicate that Shaker 
      K(+) channels play important roles in foxtail millet and provide theoretical
      support for further exploring the K(+) absorption mechanism of foxtail millet
      under abiotic stress.

TI  - Synthesis of Higher Alcohols from Syngas over a K-Modified CoMoS Catalyst
      Supported on Novel Powder and Fiber Commercial Activated Carbons.
PG  - 21346-21356
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c03082 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, a series of K-modified CoMoS catalysts with compositions of
      10% K, 3.6% Co, and 12 wt % Mo supported over novel commercial activated carbons 
      such as powder materials (DAC and OBC-1) and fiber materials (fabric active
      sorption (TCA) and nonwoven activated material (AHM)) were prepared and
      characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), SEM-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM). The catalytic activities for higher alcohol synthesis 
      from syngas, conducted at T = 300-360 degrees C, P = 5 MPa, GHSV = 760 L h(-1)
      (kg cat)(-1), and H2/CO = 1.0, were investigated. Cat-TCA and Cat-AHM have shown 
      a filamentous morphology with a strip axial arrangement and that a few
      longitudinal grooves and many irregular particles are distributed on the fiber
      surfaces. The degree of entanglement of the strip axial arrangement in AHM was
      found to be more than that in TCA, thus leading to form tangled MoS2 slabs on AHM
      and long linear slabs on TCA with long rim sites. The obtained results revealed
      that the CO conversion increases in the order Cat-TCA < Cat-OBC-1 < Cat-DAC <
      Cat-AHM. Ethanol, propanol-1, and methanol are the most predominant alcohol
      products in the collected liquid products, with the byproducts containing mainly 
      butanol-1, isobutanol, amyl alcohol, and isoamyl alcohol. Cat-DAC and Cat-OBC-1
      show higher selectivity toward C3+, C4+, propanol-1, butanol-1, isobutanol, and
      amyl alcohol-1 than Cat-TCA and Cat-AHM. For powdered activated carbons,
      microporous catalysts inhibited isomerization because the catalyst that contains 
      the highest micropores (Cat-DAC) produced a considerable amount of linear
      alcohols compared with Cat-OBC-1.

AB  - To assess a reliable safety case for future deep underground repositories for
      highly active nuclear waste the retention of radionuclides by the surrounding
      host rock must be understood comprehensively. Retention is influenced by several 
      parameters such as mineral heterogeneity and surface roughness, as well as pore
      water chemistry (e.g., pH). However, the interplay between those parameters is
      not yet well understood. Therefore, we present a correlative spectromicroscopic
      approach to investigate sorption of the actinide Cm(III) on: 1) bulk K-feldspar
      crystals to determine the effect of surface roughness and pH (5.5 and 6.9) and 2)
      a large feldspar grain as part of a complex crystalline rock system to observe
      how sorption is influenced by the surrounding heterogeneous mineralogy. Our
      findings show that rougher K-feldspar surfaces exhibit increased Cm(III) uptake
      and stronger complexation. Similarly, increasing pH leads to higher surface
      loading and stronger Cm(III) binding to the surface. Within a heterogeneous
      mineralogical system sorption is further affected by neighboring mineral
      dissolution and competitive sorption between mineral phases such as mica and
      feldspar. The obtained results express a need for investigating relevant
      processes on multiple scales of dimension and complexity to better understand
      trivalent radionuclide retention by a potential repository host rock.

AB  - This study examined 42 mushroom samples and corresponding cultivated substrates. 
      The radionuclide activity concentrations and bioconcentration factor (BCF) from
      substrate-to-mushroom were determined. The substrate activity concentrations were
      59.1-727.5, 4.5-37.6, and 4.0-53.0 Bq/kg dw (dry weight) for (40) K, (226)Ra, and
      (232)Th, respectively. The average (40) K concentrations were 1546.5, 1115.7, and
      749.3 Bq/kg dw; the BCFs were 2.49, 3.56, and 5.58 for A. bisporus, F. velutipes,
      and L. edodes, respectively. The (40) K concentrations were insignificantly
      correlated with each species' corresponding substrate concentration. The (40) K
      BCFs had a significantly negative correlation with the substrate concentration
      for each species. Each mushroom species' (40) K concentration was almost stable, 
      suggesting that (40) K has a regulated homeostasis for a given species. The
      average (226)Ra concentrations were 5.5, 5.4, and 3.4 Bq/kg dw; the BCFs were
      0.58, 0.17, and 0.50 for L. edodes, A. bisporus, and F. velutipes, respectively. 
      The average (232)Th concentrations were 4.7, 4.7, and 3.0 Bq/kg dw; the BCFs were
      0.50, 0.11, and 0.53 for L. edodes, A. bisporus, and F. velutipes, respectively. 
      The (226)Ra and (232)Th concentrations in mushrooms had a weak to moderate
      correlation with the cultivated substrate concentrations. The absorption of the
      (226)Ra and (232)Th from substrate-to-mushroom was similar to the hypothesis of
      the linear model that mushroom concentration yields a positive correlation with
      substrate concentration.

      defect and pin-clip fixation versus transverse fracture and K-wire stabilization.

AB  - Despite growing knowledge about the mechanisms of fracture healing, non-union
      formation still represents a major complication in trauma and orthopedic surgery.
      Non-union models in mice gain increasing interest, because they allow
      investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of failed fracture healing.
      These models often use segmental defects to achieve non-union formation.
      Alternatively, failed fracture healing can be induced by transverse fractures
      with additional periosteal injury. The present study systematically compared the 
      reliability of these two approaches to serve as non-union model. A 0.6 mm K-wire 
      was inserted into the femora of CD-1 mice in a retrograde fashion and a closed
      transverse femoral fracture was created. Subsequently, the fracture site was
      exposed and the periosteum was cauterized. This approach was compared with a
      well-established non-union model involving the pin-clip fixation of a 1.8 mm
      segmental defect. The callus tissue was analyzed by means of radiography,
      biomechanics, histology and Western blotting. At 10 weeks after surgery 10 out of
      12 femora (83.3 %) of the K-wire group showed a non-union formation. The pin-clip
      model resulted in 100 % non-union formation. The K-wire group showed increased
      bone formation, osteoclast activity and bending stiffness when compared to the
      group with pin-clip fixation. This was associated with a higher expression of
      bone formation markers. However, the number of CD31-positive microvessels was
      reduced in the K-wire group, indicating an impaired angiogenic capacity after
      periosteal cauterization. These findings suggest that the pin-clip model is more 
      reliable for the study of non-union formation in mice. The K-wire model including
      periosteal injury by cauterization however, may be particularly applied in
      preclinical studies which explore the effects of damaged periosteum and reduced
      angiogenic capacity to trauma-induced fractures.

      leading to accumulation of K-Ras-GTP in cells. Signaling cascades initiated by
      K-Ras-GTP promote cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Despite functional 
      differences between the most frequent G12D mutation and the most aggressive and
      chemotherapy resistant G12V mutation, their long-suspected distinct structural
      features remain elusive. Using NMR, X-ray structures, and computational methods, 
      we found that oncogenic mutants of K-Ras4B, the predominant splice variant of
      K-Ras, exhibit distinct conformational dynamics when GDP-bound, visiting the
      "active-like" conformational state similar to the one observed in GTP-bound
      K-Ras. This behavior distinguishes G12V from wild type and G12D K-Ras4B-GDP. The 
      likely reason is interactions between the aliphatic sidechain of V12 and the
      Switch II region of K-Ras4B(G12V)-GDP, which are distinct in K-Ras4B(G12D)-GDP.
      In the X-ray structures, crystal contacts reduce the dynamics of the sidechain at
      position 12 by stabilizing the Switch I region of the protein. This explains why 
      structural differences between G12V and G12D K-Ras have yet not been reported.
      Together, our results suggest a previously unknown mechanism of K-Ras activation.
      This mechanism relies on conformational dynamics caused by specific oncogenic
      mutations in the GDP-bound state. Our findings also imply that the therapeutic
      strategies decreasing the level of K-Ras-GTP by interfering with nucleotide
      exchange or by expediting GTP hydrolysis may work differently in different
      oncogenic mutants.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue activation with ginsenoside compound K ameliorates
      polycystic ovary syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/bph.15909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic
      and endocrine disease affecting women of reproductive age. Due to its complex
      aetiology, there is no currently effective cure for PCOS. Brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) activity is significantly decreased in PCOS patients, and BAT activation
      has beneficial effects in animal models of PCOS. Here, we investigated the effect
      of ginsenoside compound K (CK) in an animal model of PCOS and its mechanism of
      BAT activation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Primary brown adipocytes, Db/Db mice and
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rats were used. The core body
      temperature, oxygen consumption, energy metabolism related gene and protein
      expression were assessed to identify the effect of CK on overall energy
      metabolism. Oestrous cycle, serum sex hormone, ovarian steroidogenic enzyme gene 
      expression and ovarian morphology were also evaluated following CK treatment. KEY
      RESULTS: Our results indicated that CK treatment could significantly protect
      against body weight gain in Db/Db mice via BAT activation. Furthermore, we found 
      that CK treatment could normalize hyperandrogenism, oestrous cyclicity, normalize
      steroidogenic enzyme expression and decrease the number of cystic follicles in
      PCOS rats. Interestingly, as a potential endocrine intermediate, C-X-C motif
      chemokine ligand-14 protein (CXCL14) was significantly up-regulated following CK 
      administration. In addition, exogenous CXC14 supplementation was found to reverse
      DHEA-induced PCOS in a phenotypically similar manner to CK treatment. CONCLUSION 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: In summary, CK treatment significantly activates BAT, increases
      CXCL14 expression and ameliorates PCOS. These findings suggest that CK might be a
      potential drug candidate for PCOS treatment.

LID - 10.1111/cns.13893 [doi]
AB  - Na+-K+-ATPase, a P-type ATP-powered ion transporter on cell membrane, plays a
      vital role in cellular excitability. Cellular hyperexcitability, accompanied by
      hypersynchronous firing, is an important basis for seizures/epilepsy. An
      increasing number of studies point to a significant contribution of Na+-K+-ATPase
      to epilepsy, although discordant results exist. In this review, we
      comprehensively summarize the structure and physiological function of
      Na+-K+-ATPase in the central nervous system and critically evaluate the role of
      Na+-K+-ATPase in the epileptic brain. Importantly, we further provide
      perspectives on some possible research directions and discuss its potential as a 
      therapeutic target for the treatment of epilepsy.

TI  - Kmer2SNP: Reference-Free Heterozygous SNP Calling Using k-mer Frequency
      Distributions.
PG  - 257-265
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-2293-3_16 [doi]
AB  - DNA sequencing technologies enable the generation of genetic profiles from many
      individuals at a rapid rate. Identifying single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      between biological samples is fundamental in genetics with various applications, 
      such as disease diagnosis and associations and ancestry and relationship
      inference. Most methods use a species-specific reference genome for aligning raw 
      sequenced reads for accurate SNP calling. However, high-quality reference genomes
      may not be available for all species. Therefore, we developed a reference-free
      algorithm, Kmer2SNP, to identify heterozygous SNPs from raw sequenced reads to
      facilitate genetic studies in species without the reference genome. Kmer2SNP
      first calculates the k-mer frequency distribution from reads to determine k-mers 
      containing heterozygous SNPs. Next, these k-mers are rapidly matched with each
      other to identify pairs of exact heterozygous k-mers that belong to one of the
      two possible haplotypes in a diploid organism. Finally, using overlapping
      neighboring k-mers, weights are assigned for SNP assignments; higher weights
      increase SNP discovery confidence.

TI  - 3,5,7-Substituted Pyrazolo[4,3-d]Pyrimidine Inhibitors of Cyclin-Dependent
      Kinases and Cyclin K Degraders.
PG  - 8881-8896
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c02184 [doi]
AB  - 3,5,7-Trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines have been identified as potent
      inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are established drug
      targets. Herein, we describe their further structural modifications leading to
      novel nanomolar inhibitors with strong antiproliferative activity. We determined 
      the crystal structure of fully active CDK2/A2 with
      5-(2-amino-1-ethyl)thio-3-cyclobutyl-7-[4-(pyrazol-1-yl)benzyl]amino-1(2)H-pyrazo
      lo[4,3-d]pyrimidine (24) at 1.7 A resolution, confirming the competitive mode of 
      inhibition. Biochemical and cellular assays in lymphoma cell lines confirmed the 
      expected mechanism of action through dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein 
      and RNA polymerase II, leading to induction of apoptosis. Importantly, we also
      revealed an interesting ability of compound 24 to induce proteasome-dependent
      degradation of cyclin K both in vitro and in a patient-derived xenograft in vivo.
      We propose that 24 has a dual mechanism of action, acting as a kinase inhibitor
      and as a molecular glue inducing an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1 that leads
      to polyubiquitination of cyclin K and its subsequent degradation.

TI  - Eradication of avian leukosis virus subgroups J and K in broiler cross chickens
      by selection against infected birds using multilocus PCR.

AB  - The avian leukosis virus (ALV) is a serious threat to sustainable and
      economically viable commercial poultry management world-wide. Active infections
      can result in more than 20% flock loss, resulting in significant economic damage.
      ALV detection and elimination from flocks and breeding programs is complicated by
      high sequence variability and the presence of endogenous virus copies which show 
      up as false positives in assays. Previously-developed approaches to virus
      detection are either too labor-intensive to implement on an industrial scale or
      suffer from high false negative or positive rates. We developed a novel
      multi-locus multiplex quantitative real-time PCR system to detect viruses
      belonging to the J and K genetic subgroups that are particularly prevalent in our
      region. We used this system to eradicate ALV from our broiler breeding program
      comprising thousands of individuals. Our approach can be generalized to other ALV
      subgroups and other highly genetically diverse pathogens.

TI  - Assessment of the circulatory concentrations of cathepsin D, cathepsin K, and
      alpha-1 antitrypsin in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
LID - 10.1007/s11845-022-03061-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence has shown that cysteine protease enzymes, such as cathepsin 
      D, cathepsin A, cathepsin K, and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) are involved in the
      chronic degenerative joint process. This study aimed to determine the potential
      involvement of cathepsin K, cathepsin D, and AAT in patients with osteoarthritis 
      (OA). METHODS: This study was performed on 31 patients with knee OA and 29 age-
      and sex-matched healthy subjects (both with Fars ethnicity from Iran). American
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were used to diagnose OA patients. The
      clinical status of the patients was scored by Western Ontario McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC), and pain intensity was measured by the
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The serum level of AAT was measured using
      high-resolution cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Additionally, serum levels of 
      cathepsin D and cathepsin K were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). RESULTS: The findings showed that the serum level of cathepsin K was
      significantly increased in OA patients compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.01),
      while there was no significant difference between serum level of cathepsin D in
      study groups (P = 0.2). In addition, the serum concentration of AAT was
      significantly decreased in OA patients compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.003). 
      There was a significant correlation between WOMAC score and age (r = 0.644, P =
      0.0001) and VAS (r = 0.866, P < 0.0001) in OA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
      decreased level of AAT in OA patients and a rise in serum level of cathepsin K
      are involved in the pathogenesis of OA via stimulation of bone resorption and
      cartilage degradation.

TI  - Robust Resistive Switching Constancy and Quantum Conductance in High-k
      Dielectric-Based Memristor for Neuromorphic Engineering.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/s11671-022-03699-z [doi]
AB  - For neuromorphic computing and high-density data storage memory, memristive
      devices have recently gained a lot of interest. So far, memristive devices have
      suffered from switching parameter instability, such as distortions in resistance 
      values of low- and high-resistance states (LRSs and HRSs), dispersion in working 
      voltage (set and reset voltages), and a small ratio of high and low resistance,
      among other issues. In this context, interface engineering is a critical
      technique for addressing the variation issues that obstruct the use of memristive
      devices. Herein, we engineered a high band gap, low Gibbs free energy Al2O3
      interlayer between the HfO2 switching layer and the tantalum oxy-nitride
      electrode (TaN) bottom electrode to operate as an oxygen reservoir, increasing
      the resistance ratio between HRS and LRS and enabling multilayer data storage.
      The Pt/HfO2/Al2O3/TaN memristive device demonstrates analog bipolar resistive
      switching behavior with a potential ratio of HRS and LRS of > 10(5) and the
      ability to store multi-level data with consistent retention and uniformity. On
      set and reset voltages, statistical analysis is used; the mean values (micro) of 
      set and reset voltages are determined to be - 2.7 V and + 1.9 V, respectively.
      There is a repeatable durability over DC 1000 cycles, 10(5) AC cycles, and a
      retention time of 10(4) s at room temperature. Quantum conductance was obtained
      by increasing the reset voltage with step of 0.005 V with delay time of 0.1 s.
      Memristive device has also displayed synaptic properties like as
      potentiation/depression and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). Results show that
      engineering of interlayer is an effective approach to improve the uniformity,
      ratio of high and low resistance, and multiple conductance quantization states
      and paves the way for research into neuromorphic synapses.

TI  - Structural and cellular basis of vitamin K antagonism.
LID - 10.1111/jth.15800 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, are oral anticoagulants widely
      used to treat and prevent thromboembolic diseases. Therapeutic use of these drugs
      requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustments, whereas overdose often causes 
      severe bleeding. Addressing these drawbacks requires mechanistic understandings
      at cellular and structural levels. As the target of VKAs, vitamin K epoxide
      reductase (VKOR) generates the active, hydroquinone form of vitamin K, which in
      turn drives the gamma-carboxylation of several coagulation factors required for
      their activity. Crystal structures revealed that VKAs inhibit VKOR via mimicking 
      its catalytic process. At the active site, two strong hydrogen bonds that
      facilitate the catalysis also afford the binding specificity for VKAs. Binding of
      VKAs induces a global change from open to closed conformation. Similar
      conformational change is induced by substrate binding to promote an electron
      transfer process that reduces the VKOR active site. In the cellular environment, 
      reducing partner proteins or small reducing molecules may afford electrons to
      maintain the VKOR activity. The catalysis and VKA inhibition require VKOR in
      different cellular redox states, explaining the complex kinetics behavior of
      VKAs. Recent studies also revealed the mechanisms underlying warfarin resistance,
      warfarin dose variation, and antidoting by vitamin K. These mechanistic
      understandings may lead to improved anticoagulation strategies targeting the
      vitamin K cycle.

LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14437 [doi]
AB  - Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase (NKA) is one of the most important members of the P-type
      ion-translocating ATPases and plays a pivotal role in establishing
      electrochemical gradients for Na(+) and K(+) across the cell membrane. Presented 
      here is a 3.3 A resolution structure of NKA in the E2.2K(+) state solved by
      cryo-electron microscopy. It is a stable state with two occluded K(+) after
      transferring three Na(+) into the extracellular medium and releasing inorganic
      phosphate bound to the cytoplasmic P domain. We describe how the extracellular
      ion pathway wide open in the E2P state becomes closed and locked in E2.2K(+) ,
      linked to events at the phosphorylation site more than 50 A away. We also show,
      although at low resolution, how ATP binding to NKA in E2.2K(+) relaxes the gating
      machinery and thereby accelerates the transition into the next step, that is, the
      release of K(+) into the cytoplasm, more than 100 times.

TI  - Quad-Band Polarization-Insensitive Square Split-Ring Resonator (SSRR) with an
      Inner Jerusalem Cross Metamaterial Absorber for Ku- and K-Band Sensing
      Applications.

LID - 10.3390/s22124489 [doi]
AB  - The development of metamaterial absorbers has become attractive for various
      fields of application, such as sensing, detectors, wireless communication,
      antenna design, emitters, spatial light modulators, etc. Multiband absorbers with
      polarization insensitivity have drawn significant attention in microwave
      absorption and sensing research. In this paper, we propose a quad-band
      polarization-insensitive metamaterial absorber (MMA) for Ku- and K-band
      applications. The proposed patch comprises two square split-ring resonators
      (SSRR), four microstrip lines, and an inner Jerusalem cross to generate four
      corresponding resonances at 12.62 GHz,14.12 GHz, 17.53 GHz, and 19.91 GHz with
      97%, 99.51%, 99%, and 99.5% absorption, respectively. The complex values of
      permittivity, permeability, refractive index, and impedance of MMA were extracted
      and discussed. The absorption mechanism of the designed MMA was explored by
      impedance matching, equivalent circuit model, as well as magnetic field and
      electric field analysis. The overall patch has a rotational-symmetrical
      structure, which plays a crucial role in acquiring the polarization-insensitive
      property. The design also shows stable absorption for both transverse electric
      (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes. Its near-unity absorption and excellent 
      sensing performance make it a potential candidate for sensing applications.

TI  - Gravity-Matching Algorithm Based on K-Nearest Neighbor.
LID - 4454 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22124454 [doi]
AB  - The gravity-aided inertial navigation system is a technique using geophysical
      information, which has broad application prospects, and the gravity-map-matching 
      algorithm is one of its key technologies. A novel gravity-matching algorithm
      based on the K-Nearest neighbor is proposed in this paper to enhance the
      anti-noise capability of the gravity-matching algorithm, improve the accuracy of 
      gravity-aided navigation, and reduce the application threshold of the matching
      algorithm. This algorithm selects K sample labels by the Euclidean distance
      between sample datum and measurement, and then creatively determines the weight
      of each label from its spatial position using the weighted average of labels and 
      the constraint conditions of sailing speed to obtain the continuous navigation
      results by gravity matching. The simulation experiments of post processing are
      designed to demonstrate the efficiency. The experimental results show that the
      algorithm reduces the INS positioning error effectively, and the position error
      in both longitude and latitude directions is less than 800 m. The computing time 
      can meet the requirements of real-time navigation, and the average running time
      of the KNN algorithm at each matching point is 5.87s. This algorithm shows better
      stability and anti-noise capability in the continuously matching process.

TI  - Ginsenoside Compound K Protects against Obesity through Pharmacological Targeting
      of Glucocorticoid Receptor to Activate Lipophagy and Lipid Metabolism.
LID - 1192 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14061192 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) plays a key role in lipid
      metabolism, but investigations of GR activation as a potential therapeutic
      approach have been hampered by a lack of selective agonists. Ginsenoside compound
      K (CK) is natural small molecule with a steroid-like structure that offers a
      variety of therapeutic benefits. Our study validates CK as a novel GR agonist for
      the treatment of obesity. (2) Methods: By using pulldown and RNA interference, we
      determined that CK binds to GR. The anti-obesity potential effects of CK were
      investigated in obese mice, including through whole-body energy homeostasis,
      glucose and insulin tolerance, and biochemical and proteomic analysis. Using
      chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified GR binding sites upstream of lipase 
      ATGL. (3) Results: We demonstrated that CK reduced the weight and blood lipids of
      mice more significantly than the drug Orlistat. Proteomics data showed that CK
      up-regulated autophagy regulatory proteins, enhanced fatty acid oxidation
      proteins, and decreased fatty acid synthesis proteins. CK induced lipophagy with 
      the initial formation of the phagophore via AMPK/ULK1 activation. However, a
      blockade of autophagy did not disturb the increase in CK on lipase expression,
      suggesting that autophagy and lipase are independent pathways in the function of 
      CK. The pulldown and siRNA experiments showed that GR is the critical target.
      After binding to GR, CK not only activated lipophagy, but also promoted the
      binding of GR to the ATGL promoter. (4) Conclusions: Our findings indicate that
      CK is a natural food candidate for reducing fat content and weight.

TI  - A TCAD Study on High-Voltage Superjunction LDMOS with Variable-K Dielectric
      Trench.
LID - 843 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13060843 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a novel high voltage superjunction lateral double diffused MOSFETs
      (SJ-LDMOS) using a variable high permittivity (VHK) dielectric trench is
      presented. A relatively high HK dielectric is in the upper trench, which is
      connected with the drain electrode to suppress the high electric field (E-field) 
      peak under the drain by the dielectric reduced surface field (RESURF) effect. In 
      addition, a relatively low HK dielectric is at the bottom of the trench. On the
      one hand, the substrate is effectively depleted by a suitable HK dielectric
      layer, and the vertical depletion region of the substrate is greatly expanded. On
      the other hand, the overall vertical bulk E-field distribution is modulated by
      the E-field peaks generated at the position of varying K dielectric. A more
      uniform bulk E-field distribution is obtained for VHK SJ-LDMOS, leading to a high
      breakdown voltage (BV). Compared to the conventional SJ-LDMOS, the blocking
      voltage per micron of the drift region of VHK SJ-LDMOS has increased by 41.2%.
      Besides, compared with the SJ-LDMOS with a uniform-K, the BV of VHK SJ-LDMOS is
      improved by about 9.5%. The condition of the optimal range of the variable high
      permittivity is also presented. Meanwhile, the proposed VHK SJ-LDMOS has good
      conduction characteristics and heat dissipation.

TI  - The Sweetpotato Voltage-Gated K(+) Channel beta Subunit, KIbB1, Positively
      Regulates Low-K(+) and High-Salinity Tolerance by Maintaining Ion Homeostasis.
LID - 1100 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13061100 [doi]
AB  - Voltage-gated K(+) channel beta subunits act as a structural component of Kin
      channels in different species. The beta subunits are not essential to the channel
      activity but confer different properties through binding the T1 domain or the
      C-terminal of alpha subunits. Here, we studied the physiological function of a
      novel gene, KIbB1, encoding a voltage-gated K(+) channel beta subunit in
      sweetpotato. The transcriptional level of this gene was significantly higher in
      the low-K(+)-tolerant line than that in the low-K(+)-sensitive line under K(+)
      deficiency conditions. In Arabidopsis, KIbB1 positively regulated low-K(+)
      tolerance through regulating K(+) uptake and translocation. Under high-salinity
      stress, the growth conditions of transgenic lines were obviously better than wild
      typr (WT). Enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging
      were activated in transgenic plants. Accordingly, the malondialdehyde (MDA)
      content and the accumulation of ROS such as H2O2 and O(2-) were lower in
      transgenic lines under salt stress. It was also found that the overexpression of 
      KIbB1 enhanced K(+) uptake, but the translocation from root to shoot was not
      affected under salt stress. This demonstrates that KIbB1 acted as a positive
      regulator in high-salinity stress resistance through regulating Na(+) and K(+)
      uptake to maintain K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis. These results collectively suggest
      that the mechanisms of KIbB1 in regulating K(+) were somewhat different between
      low-K(+) and high-salinity conditions.

LID - 833 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24060833 [doi]
AB  - The spectral slope of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence varies depending on
      the spectral theory considered; -3/2 is the spectral slope in
      Kraichnan-Iroshnikov-Dobrowolny (KID) theory, -5/3 in Marsch-Matthaeus-Zhou and
      Goldreich-Sridhar theories, also called Kolmogorov-like (K-41-like) MHD theory,
      the combination of the -5/3 and -3/2 scales in Biskamp, and so on. A rigorous
      mathematical proof to any of these spectral theories is of great scientific
      interest. Motivated by the 2012 work of A. Biryuk and W. Craig (Physica D
      241(2012) 426-438), we establish inertial range bounds for K-41-like phenomenon
      in MHD turbulent flow through a mathematical rigor; a range of wave numbers in
      which the spectral slope of MHD turbulence is proportional to -5/3 is established
      and the upper and lower bounds of this range are explicitly formulated. We also
      have shown that the Leray weak solution of the standard MHD model is bonded in
      the Fourier space, the spectral energy of the system is bounded and its average
      over time decreases in time.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with vitamin K prophylaxis utilization among
      neonates in rural Ethiopia in 2016.
PG  - 361
LID - 10.1186/s12887-022-03428-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal Mortality Ratio (NMR) could not be reversed sufficiently in 
      Ethiopia in the last couple of years. Neonatal bleeding is one of the major
      causes of neonatal deaths. Administration of vitamin K prophylaxis at birth is
      the proven strategy to reduce neonatal death which can be caused by vitamin K
      deficiency bleeding. Although World Health Organization (WHO) recommends
      universal supplementation of vitamin K prophylaxis for all neonates at birth,
      many neonates could not get it in many resource poor countries. Despite its
      importance, information is scarce about uptake of vitamin K prophylaxis in
      Ethiopia in 2016. Therefore, this study aimed to identify prevalence and factors 
      associated with vitamin K prophylaxis utilization among neonates in Ethiopia in
      2016. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of EDHS 2016 was done to assess prevalence
      and predictors of vitamin K prophylaxis among neonates in Ethiopia five years
      before EDHS 2016. Multi-stage cluster sampling was used in EDHS 2016. Sample
      weight and complex analysis were used to minimize bias. Bivariate and
      multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify factors
      associated with vitamin K prophylaxis. Finally, adjusted odds ratio with 95%
      confidence interval was calculated and P-value less than 0.05 taken as the cuff
      of point for declaration of the statistical significant association. RESULTS:
      Prevalence of vitamin K prophylaxis among neonates in Ethiopia in 2016 was found 
      to be 4710(65.5%) in this study. Factors like: Institutional delivery (AOR = 2.2,
      95%CI: 1.8, 2.7), neonates from richest family (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.6, 2.7),
      neonates from richer household (AOR = 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.8), starting of
      antenatal care from 3-6 months of gestational age (AOR = 2.9, 95%CI: 2.3, 3.6)
      were factors positively associated with vitamin K prophylaxis in Ethiopia.
      CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Compared with expected world health organization
      recommendation of universal supplementation vitamin K prophylaxis, vitamin K
      utilization is lower among neonates in this study. Hence, it is recommended that 
      strengthen early antenatal care initiation and improving community awareness
      about vitamin K prophylaxis are the key interventions to improve its uptake.
      Furthermore, improving institutional delivery might increase uptake of vitamin K 
      prophylaxis.

TI  - Efficacy of Skin-to-Skin Care versus Swaddling for Pain Control Associated with
      Vitamin K Administration in Full-Term Neonates: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - fmac052 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/tropej/fmac052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of immediate
      skin-to-skin care (SSC) versus swaddling in pain response to intramuscular
      injection of vitamin K at 30 min of birth in neonates. METHODS: Healthy full-term
      newborns were enrolled immediately after normal vaginal delivery and randomized
      in two groups, SSC and swaddling. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was measured 
      before, immediately after and at 2 min after the injection. RESULTS: Total 100
      newborns were enrolled in the study (50 in each group). The mean (SD) birth
      weight of newborns in the SSC and swaddling group was 2668 (256) and 2730 (348)
      g, respectively. NIPS was comparable between the SSC and swaddling at before
      [1.78 (0.58) vs. 1.96 (0.83), p = 0.21], and immediately after the injection
      [4.82 (0.72) vs. 5.08 (0.75), p = 0.08]. NIPS at 2 min after the injection was
      significantly low in the SSC group compared to the swaddling group [1.38 (0.70)
      vs. 2.88 (1.00), p < 0.001]. At 2 min after injection, the NIPS score was
      significantly lower than baseline in the SSC group (p = 0.002), while it was
      significantly higher in the swaddling group (p < 0.001). A significantly higher
      proportion of newborns had a NIPS score of more than three at 2 min after
      injection in the swaddling group as compared to the SSC group (22% vs. 2%, p <
      0.001). CONCLUSION: Immediate SSC was more efficacious as compared to swaddling
      as a pain control intervention while giving vitamin K injection. CLINICAL TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India
      with Registration number: CTRI/2020/01/022984.

OAB - Skin-to-skin care and swaddling are commonly used non-pharmacological measures to
      reduce pain perception in neonates for invasive procedures like heel prick,
      venipuncture and vaccination. We did this randomized control trial to compare the
      efficacy of immediate skin-to-skin care after birth vs. swaddling for reducing
      neonatal pain associated with intramuscular injection of vitamin K at 30 min
      after birth. We observed that the immediate skin-to-skin care, a standard of
      care, is more efficacious in controlling pain compared to swaddling for giving
      routine intramuscular vitamin K injection within one hour of birth.

TI  - Characterization and Interaction with Biomembrane Model of Benzo[k,l]xanthene
      Lignan Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles.

LID - 10.3390/membranes12060615 [doi]
AB  - Benzo[k,l]xanthene lignans are a group of rare natural products belonging to the 
      class of polyphenols with promising biological activities and are studied as
      potential chemotherapeutic agents. The lipophilic character of a xanthene core
      makes these molecules difficult to be used in an aqueous medium, limiting their
      employment in studies for pharmaceutical applications. To overcome this problem, 
      a drug-delivery system which is able to improve the stability and bioavailability
      of the compound can be used. In this study, a bioactive benzoxanthene lignan
      (BXL) has been included in SLN. Unloaded and BXL-loaded SLN have been prepared
      using the Phase Inversion Temperature method and characterized in terms of size, 
      zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and stability. Differential scanning
      calorimetry was used to evaluate the thermotropic behavior and ability of SLN to 
      act as carriers for BXL. A biomembrane model, represented by multilamellar
      vesicles, was used to simulate the interaction of the SLN with the cellular
      membrane. Unloaded and loaded SLN were incubated with the MLV, and their
      interactions were evaluated through variations in their calorimetric curves. The 
      results obtained suggest that SLN could be used as a delivery system for BXL.

TI  - Structures and Biologic Activity of Chitonoidosides I, J, K, K1 and L-Triterpene 
      Di-, Tri- and Tetrasulfated Hexaosides from the Sea Cucumber Psolus chitonoides.
LID - 369 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20060369 [doi]
AB  - Five new triterpene di-, tri- and tetrasulfated hexaosides (chitonoidosides I
      (1), J (2), K (3), K1 (4) and L (5)) were isolated from the Far-Eastern sea
      cucumber Psolus chitonoides, collected near Bering Island (Commander Islands)
      from a depth of 100-150 m. The structural variability of the glycosides concerned
      both the aglycones (with 7(8)- or 9(11)-double bonds) and carbohydrate chains
      differing from each other by the third sugar residue (Xyl or sulfated by C-6 Glc)
      and/or by the fourth-terminal in the bottom semi-chain-residue (Glc or sulfated
      by C-6 MeGlc) as well as by the positions of a sulfate group at C-4 or C-6 in the
      sixth-terminal in the upper semi-chain-residue (MeGlc). Hemolytic activities of
      these compounds 1-5 against human erythrocytes as well as cytotoxicity against
      human cancer cell lines, HeLa, DLD-1 and HL-60, were studied. The hexaosides,
      chitonoidosides K (3) and L (5) with four sulfate groups, were the most active
      against tumor cells in all the tests. Noticeably, the sulfate group at C-4 of
      MeGlc6 did not decrease the membranolytic effect of 5 as compared with 3, having 
      the sulfate group at C-6 of MeGlc6. Erythrocytes were, as usual, more sensitive
      to the action of the studied glycosides than cancer cells, although the
      sensitivity of leukemia promyeloblast HL-60 cells was higher than that of other
      tumor cells. The glycosides 1 and 2 demonstrated some weaker action in relation
      to DLD-1 cells than against other tumor cell lines. Chitonoidoside K1 (4) with a 
      hydroxyl at C 25 of the aglycone was not active in all the tests. The metabolic
      network formed by the carbohydrate chains of all the glycosides isolated from P. 
      chitonoides as well as the aglycones biosynthetic transformations during their
      biosynthesis are discussed and illustrated with schemes.

TI  - Graphical Image Region Extraction with K-Means Clustering and Watershed.
LID - 163 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jimaging8060163 [doi]
AB  - With a wide range of applications, image segmentation is a complex and difficult 
      preprocessing step that plays an important role in automatic visual systems,
      which accuracy impacts, not only on segmentation results, but directly affects
      the effectiveness of the follow-up tasks. Despite the many advances achieved in
      the last decades, image segmentation remains a challenging problem, particularly,
      the segmenting of color images due to the diverse inhomogeneities of color,
      textures and shapes present in the descriptive features of the images. In
      trademark graphic images segmentation, beyond these difficulties, we must also
      take into account the high noise and low resolution, which are often present.
      Trademark graphic images can also be very heterogeneous with regard to the
      elements that make them up, which can be overlapping and with varying lighting
      conditions. Due to the immense variation encountered in corporate logos and
      trademark graphic images, it is often difficult to select a single method for
      extracting relevant image regions in a way that produces satisfactory results.
      Many of the hybrid approaches that integrate the Watershed and K-Means algorithms
      involve processing very high quality and visually similar images, such as medical
      images, meaning that either approach can be tweaked to work on images that follow
      a certain pattern. Trademark images are totally different from each other and are
      usually fully colored. Our system solves this difficulty given it is a
      generalized implementation designed to work in most scenarios, through the use of
      customizable parameters and completely unbiased for an image type. In this paper,
      we propose a hybrid approach to Image Region Extraction that focuses on automated
      region proposal and segmentation techniques. In particular, we analyze popular
      techniques such as K-Means Clustering and Watershedding and their effectiveness
      when deployed in a hybrid environment to be applied to a highly variable dataset.
      The proposed system consists of a multi-stage algorithm that takes as input an
      RGB image and produces multiple outputs, corresponding to the extracted regions. 
      After preprocessing steps, a K-Means function with random initial centroids and a
      user-defined value for k is executed over the RGB image, generating a gray-scale 
      segmented image, to which a threshold method is applied to generate a binary
      mask, containing the necessary information to generate a distance map. Then, the 
      Watershed function is performed over the distance map, using the markers defined 
      by the Connected Component Analysis function that labels regions on 8-way pixel
      connectivity, ensuring that all regions are correctly found. Finally, individual 
      objects are labelled for extraction through a contour method, based on border
      following. The achieved results show adequate region extraction capabilities when
      processing graphical images from different datasets, where the system correctly
      distinguishes the most relevant visual elements of images with minimal tweaking.

TI  - Diabetic family history in young Japanese persons with normal glucose tolerance
      associates with k-means clustering of glucose response to oral glucose load,
      insulinogenic index and Matsuda index.
PG  - 100196
LID - 10.1016/j.metop.2022.100196 [doi]
AB  - Aims: The present study aimed to clarify the relationships between diabetic
      family history (FH), and dysglycemic response to the oral glucose tolerance test 
      (OGTT), insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity in young Japanese persons with
      normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methods: We measured plasma glucose (PG) and
      immunoreactive insulin levels in 1,309 young Japanese persons (age <40 years)
      with NGT before and at 30, 60, and 120 min during a 75-g OGTT. Dysglycemia during
      OGTT was analyzed by k-means clustering analysis. Body mass index (BMI), blood
      pressure (BP), and lipids were measured. Insulin secretion and sensitivity
      indices were calculated. Results: PG levels during OGTT were classified by
      k-means clustering analysis into three groups with stepwise decreases in glucose 
      tolerance even among individuals with NGT. In these clusters, proportion of
      males, BMI, BP and frequency of FH were higher, and lipid levels were worse,
      together with decreasing glucose tolerance. Subjects with a diabetic FH showed
      increases in PG after glucose loading and decreases in insulinogenic index and
      Matsuda index. Conclusions: Dysglycemic response to OGTT by k-means clustering
      analysis was associated with FH in young Japanese persons with NGT. FH was also
      associated with post-loading glucose, insulinogenic index, and Matsuda index.

TI  - Psychosocial hazards, posttraumatic stress disorder, complex posttraumatic stress
      disorder, depression, and anxiety in the U.K. rail industry: A cross-sectional
      study.

AB  - This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complex PTSD,
      depression, and anxiety among U.K. rail workers. A cross-sectional survey
      examining exposure to seven psychosocial hazards (bullying/harassment; verbal
      abuse; physical and sexual assault; and hearing about, seeing the aftermath of,
      or witnessing a fatality), working conditions, physical health, and the impact of
      COVID-19 was administered to 3,912 participants. Outcome measures were the ITQ,
      PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Among trauma-exposed participants, 24.3% met the criteria for
      PTSD or CPTSD; 38.6% and 29.2% of all participants scored in the
      moderate-to-severe range on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. Data were analyzed
      using logistic and linear regression. Bullying/harassment was positively
      associated with GAD-7 scores, f(2) = .001, and PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 1.83-2.02.
      Hearing about and witnessing a fatality were associated with PTSD and CPTSD, ORs 
      = 1.77-2.10. Poorer ergonomics at work were positively associated with PHQ-9 and 
      GAD-7 scores, f(2) = .001. Higher job satisfaction was associated with lower odds
      of PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 0.87-0.91, and negatively associated with PHQ-9 and
      GAD-7 scores, f(2) = .008-.01. Work intensity was associated with PTSD and CPTSD,
      ORs = 1.79-1.83, and positively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, f(2) =
      .02-.03. Reporting more physical health problems was associated with PTSD, OR =
      1.07, and positively associated with GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, f(2) = .008-.01. The
      results suggest bullying/harassment and work intensity are important variables in
      employee mental health and could drive future research and industry initiatives.

AB  - Enzymatic biotransformation has become a widely used technique in synthetic
      chemistry to achieve difficult chemical transformations. Cytochrome P450
      monooxygenase enzymes found in nature carry out a wide range of difficult
      chemical reactions, such as the oxidation of the monoterpene indole alkaloid
      (-)-tabersonine at the unreactive 16th position on the indoline benzene ring in
      the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products such as the bis-indole
      alkaloid (-)-melodinine K. Herein, we describe the first semisynthesis of
      (-)-melodinine K enabled by a biological gram scale route to the northern
      fragment, (-)-16-hydroxytabersonine, as well as a chemical route to the southern 
      fragment, (-)-pachysiphine, both derived from (-)-tabersonine and subsequently
      coupled in only eight linear steps. (-)-16-Hydroxytabersonine is produced through
      an enzymatic biotransformation with a genetically modified Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae yeast strain expressing a tabersonine 16-hydroxylase enzyme to enable 
      regioselective oxidation on multigram scale, and (-)-pachysiphine is produced
      through stereoselective and regioselective epoxidation of the disubstituted
      alkene.

TI  - Benzimidazole resistant isolates with mutations E198A/V/K in beta-tubulin gene
      possess different fitness and competitive ability in Botrytis cinerea.
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-04-22-0120-R [doi]
AB  - Previous studies in Botrytis cinerea showed that the resistance to methyl
      benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) was mainly related to E198A/V/K and F200Y
      mutations of the beta-tubulin gene, and the E198V was the dominant mutation in
      the resistant sub-population in Hubei Province of China, indicating that
      resistant mutation might influence the fitness. However, little is known on the
      effect of each E198A/V/K mutation on fitness. In this study, the fitness and
      competitive ability of isolates with E198A/V/K mutations were investigated.
      Results showed that E198A/V/K isolates and the wild-type isolates shared similar 
      fitness components at virulence, sporulation, conidial germination, oxidative
      sensitivity, sclerotial production and viability. However, slower mycelial growth
      at 4 degrees C, higher sensitivity to 4% NaCl, and increased sclerotial
      production percentage at 4 degrees C were observed in the isolates with E198V,
      E198K, and E198A mutation, respectively. Competitive analysis showed that the
      wild-type sub-population became dominant after three disease cycles in the
      absence of fungicide selection pressure, whereas the resistant sub-population
      seized the space of sensitive sub-population upon MBC application. Unexpectedly, 
      the frequency of E198V isolates decreased dramatically since the first disease
      cycle with or without fungicide selection pressure. These results suggest that
      MBC resistant isolates suffer little fitness penalty, but possess competitive
      disadvantages in the absence of fungicide selection pressure. Under fungicide
      selection pressure, E198V isolates could not compete with E198A/K isolates.
      According to the current results, there was a great possibility that the E198V
      mutation would lose the dominance in the future in China.

AB  - In this paper we study the k-domination and total k-domination numbers of
      catacondensed hexagonal systems. More precisely, we give the value of the total
      domination number, we find upper and lower bounds for the 2-domination number and
      the total 2-domination number, characterizing the catacondensed hexagonal systems
      which attain these bounds, and we give the value of the 3-domination number for
      any catacondensed hexagonal system with a given number of hexagons. These results
      complete the study of k-domination and total k-domination of catacondensed
      hexagonal systems for all possible values of k.

TI  - Link importance assessment strategy based on improved k-core decomposition in
      complex networks.
PG  - 7019-7031
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2022331 [doi]
AB  - Improving the effectiveness of target link importance assessment strategy has
      become an important research direction within the field of complex networks
      today. The reasearch shows that the link importance assessment strategy based on 
      betweenness centrality is the current optimal solution, but its high
      computational complexity makes it difficult to meet the application requirements 
      of large-scale networks. The k-core decomposition method, as a theoretical tool
      that can effectively analyze and characterize the topological properties of
      complex networks and systems, has been introduced to facilitate the generation of
      link importance assessment strategy and, based on this, a link importance
      assessment indicator link shell has been developed. The strategy achieves better 
      results in numerical simulations. In this study, we incorporated topological
      overlap theory to further optimize the attack effect and propose a new link
      importance assessment indicator link topological shell called t-shell.
      Simulations using real world networks and scale-free networks show that t-shell
      based target link importance assessment strategies perform better than shell
      based strategies without increasing the computational complexity; this can
      provide new ideas for the study of large-scale network destruction strategies.

TI  - [Cumulative effects of K-function in the research of point patterns].
PG  - 1275-1282
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202205.005 [doi]
AB  - The spatial pattern of plant population is one of primary issues in ecological
      research. Point pattern analy-sis is considered as an important method to study
      the spatial pattern of plant population. Ripley's K function has been commonly
      used for point pattern analysis. However, the cumulative effect of Ripley's K
      function may lead to specific spatial pattern charcteristics. To explore how the 
      cumulative effect of Ripley's K function affects population pattern, the data of 
      clumped distribution, random distribution and regular distribution of Stipa
      grandis were simulated by R software. All data generated by R software were
      analyzed by Ripley's K function and the non-cumulative pairwise correlation
      function g(r). The results showed that for clumped distribution (or regular
      distribution), the cumulative effect of Ripley's K function was manifested in two
      aspects. On the one hand, the scale of clumped distribution (or regular
      distribution) was increased due to Ripley's K function. On the other hand,
      Ripley's K function could detect the difference of the distribution of cluster
      (or negative interaction range) in the sampling space, exhibiting different
      pattern characteristics. For random distribution, Ripley's K function had no
      cumulative effect. In conclusion, the combination of Ripley's K function and
      pairwise correlation function by collecting replicate samples could better reveal
      the essential characteristics of the pattern in the study of population pattern.

AB  - Longitudinal-optical (LO) mode phonon branches of KCl and NaCl were measured
      using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) at 300 K and calculated by the
      first-principles phonon calculation with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic 
      approximation. Spectral shapes of the IXS measurements and calculated spectral
      functions agreed well. We analyzed the calculated spectral functions that provide
      higher resolutions of the spectra than the IXS measurements. Due to strong
      anharmonicity, the spectral functions of these phonon branches have several peaks
      and the LO modes along Gamma-L paths are disconnected.

TI  - Cathepsin K Deficiency Prevented Kidney Damage and Dysfunction in Response to 5/6
      Nephrectomy Injury in Mice With or Without Chronic Stress.
PG  - 1713-1723
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic psychological stress is a risk factor for kidney disease,
      including kidney dysfunction and hypertension. Lysosomal CatK (cathepsin K)
      participates in various human pathobiologies. We investigated the role of CatK in
      kidney remodeling and hypertension in response to 5/6 nephrectomy injury in mice 
      with or without chronic stress. METHODS: Male 7-week-old WT (wild type;
      CatK(+/+)) and CatK-deficient (CatK(-/-)) mice that were or were not subjected to
      chronic stress underwent 5/6 nephrectomy. At 8 weeks post-stress/surgery, the
      stress was observed to have accelerated injury-induced glomerulosclerosis,
      proteinuria, and blood pressure elevation. RESULTS: Compared with the nonstressed
      mice, the stressed mice showed increased levels of TLR (Toll-like receptor)-2/4, 
      p22(phox), gp91(phox), CatK, MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-2/9, collagen type I 
      and III genes, PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma),
      NLRP-3 (NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3), p21, p16,
      and cleaved caspase-8 proteins, podocyte foot process effacement, macrophage
      accumulation, apoptosis, and decreased levels of Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma 2) and
      Sirt1, as well as decreased glomerular desmin expression in the kidneys. These
      harmful changes were retarded by the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of
      CatK. Consistently, CatK inhibition ameliorated 5/6 nephrectomy-related kidney
      injury and dysfunction. In mesangial cells, CatK silencing or overexpression,
      respectively, reduced or increased the PPAR-gamma and cleaved caspase-8 protein
      levels, providing evidence and a mechanistic explanation of CatK's involvement in
      PPAR-gamma/caspase-8-mediated cell apoptosis in response to superoxide and
      stressed serum. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CatK plays an
      essential role in kidney remodeling and hypertension in response to 5/6
      nephrectomy or stress, possibly via a reduction of glomerular inflammation,
      apoptosis, and fibrosis, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling 
      kidney injury in mice under chronic psychological stress conditions.

PG  - 591
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05550-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective study included an alternative treatment for types 
      A2, A3, and B1 distal radius fractures using percutaneous fixation with a
      cemented K-wire frame. METHODS: From January 2017 to January 2020, 78 patients
      with distal radius fractures were treated with percutaneous internal fixation
      using a cemented K-wire frame. There were 47 male patients and 31 female
      patients. The fractures were classified into types A2 (n = 10), A3 (n = 46), and 
      B1 (n = 22). X-rays were taken immediately after surgery and after the bone had
      healed. Wrist function was assessed using the Mayo Wrist Score (90-100,
      excellent; 80-90, good; 60-80, satisfactory; < 60, poor). Patient satisfaction
      was assessed using the 10-cm visual analog scale. RESULTS: Neither fixation
      failure nor K-wire migration was found (P > 0.05). Osteomyelitis was not observed
      in this series. All patients achieved bone healing after a mean of 4.5 weeks
      (range, 4 to 8 weeks). Follow-up lasted a mean of 27 months (range, 24 to 33
      months). The mean score of wrist function was 97 (range, 91 to 100). Among them, 
      66 results were excellent and 12 results were good. The mean patient satisfaction
      was 10 cm (range, 8 to 10 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous fixation with cemented
      K-wire frame is a safe and preferred choice for the treatment of types A2, A3,
      and B1 distal radius fractures. The frame provides support to prevent wire
      migration. The fixation technique is a minimally invasive procedure that is easy 
      to perform. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, Level IVa.

AB  - The etiology of epilepsy remains undefined in two-thirds of patients. Here, we
      identified a de novo variant of ATP1A2 (c.2426 T > G, p.Leu809Arg), which encodes
      the alpha2 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase(,) from a family with idiopathic
      epilepsy. This variant caused epilepsy with hemiplegic migraine in the study
      patients. We generated the point variant mouse model Atp1a2(L809R), which
      recapitulated the epilepsy observed in the study patients. In Atp1a2(L809R/WT)
      mice, convulsions were observed and cognitive and memory function was impaired.
      This variant affected the potassium binding function of the protein, disabling
      its ion transport ability, thereby increasing the frequency of nerve impulses.
      Valproate (VPA) and Carbamazepine (CBZ) have limited therapeutic efficacy in
      ameliorating the epileptic syndromes of Atp1a2(L809R/WT) mice. Our work revealed 
      that ATP1A2(L809R) variants cause a predisposition to epilepsy. Moreover, we
      provide a point variant mouse model for epilepsy research and drug screening.

TI  - Privacy-preserving k-NN interpolation over two encrypted databases.
PG  - e965
LID - 10.7717/peerj-cs.965 [doi]
AB  - Cloud computing enables users to outsource their databases and the computing
      functionalities to a cloud service provider to avoid the cost of maintaining a
      private storage and computational requirements. It also provides universal access
      to data, applications, and services without location dependency. While cloud
      computing provides many benefits, it possesses a number of security and privacy
      concerns. Outsourcing data to a cloud service provider in encrypted form may help
      to overcome these concerns. However, dealing with the encrypted data makes it
      difficult for the cloud service providers to perform some operations over the
      data that will especially be required in query processing tasks. Among the
      techniques employed in query processing task, the k-nearest neighbor method draws
      attention due to its simplicity and efficiency, particularly on massive data
      sets. A number of k-nearest neighbor algorithms for query processing task on a
      single encrypted database have been proposed. However, the performance of
      k-nearest neighbor algorithms on a single database may create accuracy and
      reliability problems. It is a fact that collaboration among different cloud
      service providers yields more accurate and more reliable results in query
      processing. By considering this fact, we focus on the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN)
      problem over two encrypted databases. We introduce a secure two-party k-NN
      interpolation protocol that enables a query owner to extract the interpolation of
      the k-nearest neighbors of a query point from two different databases outsourced 
      to two different cloud service providers. We also show that our protocol protects
      the confidentiality of the data and the query point, and hides data access
      patterns. Furthermore, we conducted a number of experiment to demonstrate the
      efficiency of our protocol. The results show that the running time of our
      protocol is linearly dependent on both the number of nearest neighbours and data 
      size.

TI  - Increased Production of Ginsenoside Compound K by Optimizing the Feeding of
      American Ginseng Extract during Fermentation by Aspergillus tubingensis.
PG  - 902-910
LID - 10.4014/jmb.2203.03059 [doi]
AB  - The ginsenoside compound K (C-K) is widely used in traditional medicines,
      nutritional supplements, and cosmetics owing to its diverse pharmacological
      activities. Although many studies on C-K production have been conducted,
      fermentation is reported to produce C-K with low concentration and productivity. 
      In the present study, addition of an inducer and optimization of the carbon and
      nitrogen sources in the medium were performed using response surface methodology 
      to increase the C-K production via fermentation by Aspergillus tubingensis, a
      generally recognized as safe fungus. The optimized inducer and carbon and
      nitrogen sources were 2 g/l rice straw, 10 g/l sucrose, and 10 g/l soy protein
      concentrate, respectively, and they resulted in a 3.1-fold increase in the
      concentration and productivity of C-K (0.22 g/l and 1.52 mg/l/h, respectively)
      compared to those used before optimization without inducer (0.071 g/l and 0.49
      mg/l/h, respectively). The feeding methods of American ginseng extract (AGE),
      including feeding timing, feeding concentration, and feeding frequency, were also
      optimized. Under the optimized conditions, A. tubingensis produced 3.96 mM (2.47 
      g/l) C-K at 144 h by feeding two times with 8 g/l AGE at 48 and 60 h, with a
      productivity of 17.1 mg/l/h. The concentration and productivity of C-K after
      optimization of feeding methods were 11-fold higher than those before the
      optimization (0.22 g/l and 1.52 mg/l/h, respectively). Thus, the optimization for
      the feeding methods of ginseng extract is an efficient strategy to increase C-K
      production. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported C-K concentration and 
      productivity via fermentation reported so far.

AB  - Classification of viruses into their taxonomic ranks (e.g., order, family, and
      genus) provides a framework to organize an abundant population of viruses.
      Next-generation metagenomic sequencing technologies lead to a rapid increase in
      generating sequencing data of viruses which require bioinformatics tools to
      analyze the taxonomy. Many metagenomic taxonomy classifiers have been developed
      to study microbiomes, but it is particularly challenging to assign the taxonomy
      of diverse virus sequences and there is a growing need for dedicated methods to
      be developed that are optimized to classify virus sequences into their taxa. For 
      taxonomic classification of viruses from metagenomic sequences, we developed
      VirusTaxo using diverse (e.g., 402 DNA and 280 RNA) genera of viruses. VirusTaxo 
      has an average accuracy of 93% at genus level prediction in DNA and RNA viruses. 
      VirusTaxo outperformed existing taxonomic classifiers of viruses where it
      assigned taxonomy of a larger fraction of metagenomic contigs compared to other
      methods. Benchmarking of VirusTaxo on a collection of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
      libraries and metavirome datasets suggests that VirusTaxo can characterize virus 
      taxonomy from highly diverse contigs and provide a reliable decision on the
      taxonomy of viruses.

TI  - Sensitivity of the S1 neuronal calcium network to insulin and Bay-K 8644 in vivo:
      Relationship to gait, motivation, and aging processes.
PG  - e13661
LID - 10.1111/acel.13661 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal hippocampal Ca(2+) dysregulation is a critical component of cognitive
      decline in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease and is suggested to impact
      communication and excitability through the activation of a larger after
      hyperpolarization. However, few studies have tested for the presence of Ca(2+)
      dysregulation in vivo, how it manifests, and whether it impacts network function 
      across hundreds of neurons. Here, we tested for neuronal Ca(2+) network
      dysregulation in vivo in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of anesthetized
      young and aged male Fisher 344 rats using single-cell resolution techniques.
      Because S1 is involved in sensory discrimination and proprioception, we tested
      for alterations in ambulatory performance in the aged animal and investigated two
      potential pathways underlying these central aging- and Ca(2+) -dependent changes.
      Compared to young, aged animals displayed increased overall activity and
      connectivity of the network as well as decreased ambulatory speed. In aged
      animals, intranasal insulin (INI) increased network synchronicity and ambulatory 
      speed. Importantly, in young animals, delivery of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)
      channel modifier Bay-K 8644 altered network properties, replicating some of the
      changes seen in the older animal. These results suggest that hippocampal Ca(2+)
      dysregulation may be generalizable to other areas, such as S1, and might engage
      modalities that are associated with locomotor stability and motivation to
      ambulate. Further, given the safety profile of INI in the clinic and the evidence
      presented here showing that this central dysregulation is sensitive to insulin,
      we suggest that these processes can be targeted to potentially increase
      motivation and coordination while also reducing fall frequency with age.

      fibrillation canine model.

AB  - Since information is still limited whether atrial IK,ACh may become a potential
      therapeutic target to terminate persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), we assessed 
      it by using the persistent AF canine model with representative IK,ACh inhibitor
      AVE0118 and class I drugs. AVE0118 (6 mg/kg, n = 7), disopyramide (3 mg/kg, n =
      7) and cibenzoline (3 mg/kg, n = 6) terminated the AF in 3/7, 1/7 and 2/6
      animals, respectively, whereas aprindine (3 mg/kg, n = 6) did not suppress it.
      These findings suggest that IK,ACh inhibition in addition to open-state INa
      suppression with slow dissociation kinetics can synergistically exert potent
      antiarrhythmic action against persistent AF.

AB  - Large conductance, calcium/voltage-gated potassium channels (BK) regulate
      critical body processes, including neuronal, secretory and smooth muscle (SM)
      function. While BK-forming alpha subunits are ubiquitous, accessory beta1
      subunits are highly expressed in SM. This makes beta1 an attractive target for
      pharmaceutical development to treat SM disorders, such as hypertension or
      cerebrovascular spasm. Compounds activating BK via beta1 have been identified,
      yet they exhibit low potency and off-target effects while antagonists that limit 
      agonist activity via beta 1 remain unexplored. Beta1-dependent BK ligand-based
      pharmacophore modeling and ZINC database searches identified 15 commercially
      available hits. Concentration-response curves on BK alpha + beta1
      subunit-mediated currents were obtained in CHO cells. One potent (EC50 = 20 nM)
      and highly efficacious activator (maximal activation = x10.3 of control) was
      identified along with a potent antagonist (KB = 3.02 nM), both of which were
      dependent on beta1. Our study provides the first proof-of-principle that an
      agonist/antagonist pair can be used to control beta1-containing BK activity.

      channels.
LID - 10.1038/s41401-022-00935-1 [doi]
AB  - Small- and intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa2.x/KCa3.1 also
      called SK/IK) channels are gated exclusively by intracellular Ca(2+). The Ca(2+) 
      binding protein calmodulin confers sub-micromolar Ca(2+) sensitivity to the
      channel-calmodulin complex. The calmodulin C-lobe is constitutively associated
      with the proximal C-terminus of the channel. Interactions between calmodulin
      N-lobe and the channel S4-S5 linker are Ca(2+)-dependent, which subsequently
      trigger conformational changes in the channel pore and open the gate. KCNN genes 
      encode four subtypes, including KCNN1 for KCa2.1 (SK1), KCNN2 for KCa2.2 (SK2),
      KCNN3 for KCa2.3 (SK3), and KCNN4 for KCa3.1 (IK). The three KCa2.x channel
      subtypes are expressed in the central nervous system and the heart. The KCa3.1
      subtype is expressed in the erythrocytes and the lymphocytes, among other
      peripheral tissues. The impact of dysfunctional KCa2.x/KCa3.1 channels on human
      health has not been well documented. Human loss-of-function KCa2.2 mutations have
      been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders. Human gain-of-function mutations
      that increase the apparent Ca(2+) sensitivity of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels have 
      been associated with Zimmermann-Laband syndrome and hereditary xerocytosis,
      respectively. This review article discusses the physiological significance of
      KCa2.x/KCa3.1 channels, the pathophysiology of the diseases linked with
      KCa2.x/KCa3.1 mutations, the structure-function relationship of the mutant
      KCa2.x/KCa3.1 channels, and potential pharmacological therapeutics for the
      KCa2.x/KCa3.1 channelopathy.

TI  - Centromeric protein K (CENPK) promotes gastric cancer proliferation and migration
      via interacting with XRCC5.
LID - 10.1007/s10120-022-01311-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CENPK is a novel oncogene which is aberrantly expression in some
      malignant tumors. However, the role and mechanisms of CENPK in gastric cancer
      have not been explored. METHODS: In this study, we use RT-PCR and IHC to study
      CENPK expression in gastric cancer cells and tissues. In addition, we constructed
      the two kinds of CENPK siRNA lentivirus to knock down CENPK. Then, we use High
      content living cell imaging System, Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, wound 
      healing and Transwell assays to demonstrate the function of CENPK on gastric
      cancer cells AGS and MKN45. Meanwhile, we use flow cytometry assay to study CENPK
      function on gastric cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Subcutaneous
      tumorigenesis in nude mice was also performed to confirm CENPK function on
      gastric cancer. Finally, we use Co-IP, LC-MS and function rescue assay to study
      the downstream interaction molecular of CENPK. RESULTS: We demonstrated that
      CENPK expression were up-regulated in GC cell lines. Poor differentiation and
      III-IV stage had more percentages of high CENPK expression. Knocking down CENPK
      could significantly suppress GC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and 
      induce GC cells apoptosis and G1/S phase transition arrest. Subcutaneous
      tumorigenesis confirmed the tumor-promoting effects of CENPK in vivo. Remarkably,
      we found for the first time that XRCC5 might be interacted with CENPK through
      Co-IP, LC-MS and rescue study. CONCLUSION: CENPK promotes GC cell proliferation
      and migration via interacting with XRCC5 and may be a novel prognostic factor or 
      therapeutic target for CENPK.

TI  - Angular Analysis of D^{0}-->pi^{+}pi^{-}mu^{+}mu^{-} and
      D^{0}-->K^{+}K^{-}mu^{+}mu^{-} Decays and Search for CP Violation.
PG  - 221801
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.221801 [doi]
AB  - The first full angular analysis and an updated measurement of the decay-rate CP
      asymmetry of the D^{0}-->pi^{+}pi^{-}mu^{+}mu^{-} and
      D^{0}-->K^{+}K^{-}mu^{+}mu^{-} decays are reported. The analysis uses
      proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector at center-of-mass
      energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity
      of 9 fb^{-1}. The full set of CP -averaged angular observables and their CP
      asymmetries are measured as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. The results 
      are consistent with expectations from the standard model and with CP symmetry.

TI  - Joint Optimization of k-t Sampling Pattern and Reconstruction of DCE MRI for
      Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimation.
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3184261 [doi]
AB  - This work proposes to develop and evaluate a deep learning framework that jointly
      optimizes k-t sampling patterns and reconstruction for head and neck dynamic
      contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI aiming to reduce bias and uncertainty of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimation. 2D Cartesian phase encoding k-space
      subsampling patterns for a 3D spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) sequence
      along a time course of DCE MRI were jointly optimized in a deep learning-based
      dynamic MRI reconstruction network by a loss function concerning both
      reconstruction image quality and PK parameter estimation accuracy. During
      training, temporal k-space data sharing scheme was optimized as well. The
      proposed method was trained and tested by multi-coil complex digital reference
      objects of DCE images (mcDROs). The PK parameters estimated by the proposed
      method were compared with two published iterative DCE MRI reconstruction schemes 
      using normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSEs) and Bland-Altman analysis at
      temporal resolutions of Deltat=2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s, which correspond to
      undersampling rates of R=50, 34, 25, and 20. The proposed method achieved low PK 
      parameter NRMSEs at all four temporal resolutions compared with the benchmark
      methods on testing mcDROs. The Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the proposed 
      method reduced PK parameter estimation bias and uncertainty in tumor regions at
      temporal resolution of 2s. The proposed method also showed robustness to contrast
      arrival timing variations across patients. This work provides a potential way to 
      increase PK parameter estimation accuracy and precision, and thus facilitate the 
      clinical translation of DCE MRI.

LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09625 [doi]
AB  - Latitude is source of variations of plant species diversity and stand structure. 
      This study aimed to characterize the populations of the African grape tree,
      Lannea microcarpa, in its range in Burkina Faso. Data were collected according to
      oriented sampling scheme, based on the presence of the species. Overall, 140
      inventory plots of 1000 m(2) each were considered across the sub-Sahelian,
      north-Sudanian and south-Sudanian phytogeographical zones. Tree diameter at
      breast height (DBH) and total height of L. microcarpa individuals were measured
      and all woody species in each plot were recorded. A comparative analysis was made
      between zones for woody flora diversity associated with L. microcarpa,
      dendrometric and stand structure parameters. The results revealed a total woody
      flora richness of 109 species. Correlogram analysis revealed that species
      associated with L. microcarpa differed between phytogeographical zones. Ten
      species showed a probability of association with L. microcarpa. The density of L.
      microcarpa populations and the floristic diversity of its habitats decreased
      significantly (p < 0.001) from sub-Sahelian to south-Sudanian zones. The diameter
      classes' structure in the three phytogeographical zones revealed unstable
      populations with a predominance of intermediate classes compared to extreme
      classes. The height structure of juveniles is marked by a poor transition between
      the different classes, showing unpredictable regeneration of L. microcarpa in the
      three phytogeographical zones. The results of this study draw attention to the
      need to adopt conservation measures for the species. In this sense, the data on
      the comparative demographic characteristics can serve as a basis for the
      implementing of adequate management strategies of natural populations of the
      species across its distribution range in Burkina Faso.

      indicated that the mean concentration of COD in water was in the range of 5.25
      mg/L and 208.25 mg/L and showed a significant and exponential decrease along the 
      subsequent sampling sites (P < 0.05). The mean concentrations of K, As, Cd, and
      Cr (82.192 mg/kg, 0.730 mg/kg, 0.06 mg/kg, and 19.776 mg/kg, respectively) were
      significantly lower values in the outlet than in the inlet of the sediment
      samples (P < 0.05). All the metal concentrations in the aboveground tissue of
      macrophytes were significantly lower at the outlet sample site (P < 0.05)
      indicating that these compartments are contributing to the retention of metals
      and organic matter present in wastewater discharged in the wetland through sinks 
      and conversions of these compounds. However, there was no significant removal
      effect for heavy metals like Fe, Zn, and As (P > 0.05). This is a pointer to the 
      fact that natural wetlands can be used effectively for wastewater treatment with 
      strong monitoring programs and ecological indicators for the sustainable
      management and conservation of the flora and fauna present in it.

AB  - Monitoring of water distribution network (WDN) requires placement of sensors at
      strategic locations to detect maximum contamination events at the earliest. The
      multi-objective optimization (MOO) of sensor placement is a complicated problem
      owing to its combinatorial nature, interconnected and large WDN sizes, and
      temporal flows producing complex outcomes for a given set of contamination
      events. In this study, a new method is proposed to reduce the complexity of the
      problem by condensing the nodal search space. This method first segregates the
      nodes based on intrusion events detected, using k-means clustering, followed by
      selecting nodes from each group based on the improvement observed in the
      objectives, namely, contamination event detection, expected detection time, and
      affected population. The selected nodes formed the decision variable space for
      the MOO study. The developed strategy was tested on two benchmark networks: BWSN 
      Network1 and C-town network, and its performance is compared with the traditional
      method in terms of hypervolume contribution rate (CR) indicator and the number of
      Pareto points. The optimal subset of nodes generated twice the number of Pareto
      points than the complete set of nodes set for placing 20 sensors and had 10% more
      than CR indicator than the traditional method. For the placement of 5 sensors,
      the proposed solutions were better at the higher detection likelihood values,
      which is required to achieve maximum detection. The proposed sensor placement
      algorithm can be easily scaled to large WDNs. It is expected to provide a better 
      optimal sensor placement solution irrespective of network size as compared to the
      traditional approach.

TI  - The cell cycle gene centromere protein K (CENPK) contributes to the malignant
      progression and prognosis of prostate cancer.
PG  - 1099-1111
LID - 10.21037/tcr-21-2164 [doi]
AB  - Background: The cell cycle gene centromere protein K (CENPK) is upregulated in
      various cancers; however, the clinical value and mechanism of CENPK in prostate
      cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain unclear.
      Methods: The expression of CENPK in PCa was analyzed in both patients with PCa
      and cell lines using immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time quantitative reverse
      transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot and bioinformatics analyses. Knockdown 
      of CENPK in PCa cells was achieved by transfecting siRNAs and assessed using
      qRT-PCR and Western blotting. MTT and colony formation assays were used to assess
      the growth of PCa cells. The cell cycle was analyzed using propidium iodide (PI) 
      staining and flow cytometry. To study the possible biological function of CENPK, 
      pathway enrichment analysis was performed by dividing these groups into a high
      CENPK expression group and a low CENPK expression group based on the median CENPK
      expression level. Finally, the correlation between CENPK expression in PCa and
      clinical parameters was evaluated. Results: Our study revealed that CENPK was
      expressed at high levels in CRPC tissues and cell lines compared to primary PCa. 
      The downregulation of CENPK significantly inhibited cell viability and reduced
      the number of colonies formed by LNCaP-AI and DU145 cells (two CRPC cell lines). 
      Gene enrichment and flow cytometry analyses showed that high CENPK expression was
      linked to mitotic spindles and the cell cycle and may be involved in mitosis in
      the cell cycle of cancer cells to modulate cell proliferation and promote the
      development of CRPC. Moreover, patients exhibiting higher expression of the CENPK
      mRNA experienced shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
      than the lower expression group. Conclusions: This study provides novel molecular
      insights into the role of CENPK in castration-resistant PCa cells and reveals
      that an increase in CENPK expression may indicate shorter DFS and a poor
      prognosis for patients with PCa. Targeting CENPK may be a novel strategy for the 
      treatment of PCa.

PG  - e2204620119

AB  - In neurosecretion, allosteric communication between voltage sensors and Ca(2+)
      binding in BK channels is crucially involved in damping excitatory stimuli.
      Nevertheless, the voltage-sensing mechanism of BK channels is still under debate.
      Here, based on gating current measurements, we demonstrate that two arginines in 
      the transmembrane segment S4 (R210 and R213) function as the BK gating charges.
      Significantly, the energy landscape of the gating particles is electrostatically 
      tuned by a network of salt bridges contained in the voltage sensor domain (VSD). 
      Molecular dynamics simulations and proton transport experiments in the
      hyperpolarization-activated R210H mutant suggest that the electric field drops
      off within a narrow septum whose boundaries are defined by the gating charges.
      Unlike Kv channels, the charge movement in BK appears to be limited to a small
      displacement of the guanidinium moieties of R210 and R213, without significant
      movement of the S4.

TI  - Neuronal G protein-gated K(+) channels.
PG  - C439-C460
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00102.2022 [doi]
AB  - G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK/Kir3) channels exert a critical
      inhibitory influence on neurons. Neuronal GIRK channels mediate the G
      protein-dependent, direct/postsynaptic inhibitory effect of many
      neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, 
      adenosine, somatostatin, and enkephalin. In addition to their complex regulation 
      by G proteins, neuronal GIRK channel activity is sensitive to
      phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphorylation, regulator of G
      protein signaling (RGS) proteins, intracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+), and
      cholesterol. The application of genetic and viral manipulations in rodent models,
      together with recent progress in the development of GIRK channel modulators, has 
      increased our understanding of the physiological and behavioral impact of
      neuronal GIRK channels. Work in rodent models has also revealed that neuronal
      GIRK channel activity is modified, transiently or persistently, by various
      stimuli including exposure drugs of abuse, changes in neuronal activity patterns,
      and aversive experience. A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence
      suggests that dysregulation of GIRK channel activity contributes to neurological 
      diseases and disorders. The primary goals of this review are to highlight
      fundamental principles of neuronal GIRK channel biology, mechanisms of GIRK
      channel regulation and plasticity, the nascent landscape of GIRK channel
      pharmacology, and the potential relevance of GIRK channels to the pathophysiology
      and treatment of neurological diseases and disorders.

AB  - T cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines are a major driver of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Although these cytokines have traditionally been
      attributed to CD4 T cells, we have found that CD8 T cells are notably abundant in
      synovium and make more interferon (IFN)-gamma and nearly as much tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) as their CD4 T cell counterparts. Furthermore, using unbiased
      high-dimensional single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometric data, we found that the 
      vast majority of synovial tissue and synovial fluid CD8 T cells belong to an
      effector CD8 T cell population characterized by high expression of granzyme K
      (GzmK) and low expression of granzyme B (GzmB) and perforin. Functional
      experiments demonstrate that these GzmK(+) GzmB(+) CD8 T cells are major cytokine
      producers with low cytotoxic potential. Using T cell receptor repertoire data, we
      found that CD8 GzmK(+) GzmB(+) T cells are clonally expanded in synovial tissues 
      and maintain their granzyme expression and overall cell state in blood,
      suggesting that they are enriched in tissue but also circulate. Using GzmK and
      GzmB signatures, we found that GzmK-expressing CD8 T cells were also the major
      CD8 T cell population in the gut, kidney, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting that they form a core population of
      tissue-associated T cells across diseases and human tissues. We term this
      population tissue-enriched expressing GzmK or TteK CD8 cells. Armed to produce
      cytokines in response to both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent stimuli, 
      CD8 TteK cells have the potential to drive inflammation.

AB  - The reaction of a ground-state O atom with carbonyl sulfide is of interest for
      atmospheric (stratosphere and hot near-source volcanic plume) and combustion
      chemistry. In the present work, we employed a discharge-flow system combined with
      a modulated molecular beam mass spectrometry technique to measure the rate
      constant and products of the O + OCS reaction. The overall rate constant was
      determined either from the kinetics of the reaction product, SO radical,
      formation or under pseudo-first-order conditions from the decays of OCS in an
      excess of oxygen atoms: k1 = 1.92 x 10(-12) x (T/298)(2.08)exp(-1524/T) cm(3)
      molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 220-960 K, with conservative uncertainty of 20%. The
      yield of another reaction product, CO2, was found to increase from 3.55% at T =
      455 K to 14.2% at T = 960 K, resulting in the following Arrhenius expression for 
      the rate constant of the minor (S + CO2 forming) reaction channel: k1b = 4.19 x
      10(-11)exp(-4088/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 455-960 K (with an
      uncertainty of 25%). The kinetic and mechanistic data from the present work are
      discussed in comparison with previous experimental and computational studies.

AB  - The crystal structure of samarium iron borate was analyzed with regard to growth 
      conditions and temperature. The inclusion of about 7% Bi atoms in the crystals
      grown using the Bi2Mo3O12-based flux was discovered and there were no impurities 
      in the crystals grown using the Li2WO4-based flux. No pronounced structural
      features associated with Bi inclusion were observed. The different absolute
      configurations of the samples grown using both fluxes were demonstrated. Below 80
      K, a negative thermal expansion of the c unit-cell parameter was found. The
      structure of (Sm0.93Bi0.07)Fe3(BO3)4 belongs to the trigonal space group R32 in
      the temperature range 90-400 K. A decrease in the (Sm,Bi)-O, Sm-B, Sm-Fe, Fe-O,
      Fe-B and Fe-Fe distances is observed with a lowering of the temperature, B1-O
      does not change, B2-O increases slightly and the B2O3 triangles deviate from the 
      ab plane. The strongest decrease in the equivalent isotropic atomic displacement 
      parameters (Ueq) with decreasing temperature is observed for atoms Sm and O2, and
      the weakest is observed for B1. The O2 atoms have the highest Ueq values, the
      most elongated atomic displacement ellipsoids of all the atoms and the smallest
      number of allowed vibrational modes of all the O atoms. The largest number of
      allowed vibrational modes and the strongest interactions with neighbouring atoms 
      is seen for the B atoms, and the opposite is seen for the Sm atoms. The
      quadrupole splitting Delta(T) of the paramagnetic Mossbauer spectra increases
      linearly with cooling. The Neel temperature [TN = 31.93 (5) K] was determined
      from the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field Bhf(T), which has
      a non-Brillouin character. The easy-plane long-range magnetic ordering below TN
      was confirmed.

      6.68093 (7) A and V = 733.126 (9) A(3) at 4.2 K] and the thermal expansivity of
      alpha-ammonium carbamate has been measured over the temperature range 4.2-180 K. 
      The expansivity shows a high degree of anisotropy, with the b axis most
      expandable. The ab initio computational studies were carried out on the alpha-
      and beta-polymorphs of ammonium carbamate using density functional theory.
      Fitting equations of state to the P(V) points of the simulations (run athermally)
      gave the following values: V0 = 744 (2) A(3) and bulk modulus K0 = 16.5 (4) GPa
      for the alpha-polymorph, and V0 = 713.6 (5) A(3) and K0 = 24.4 (4) GPa for the
      beta-polymorph. The simulations show good agreement with the thermoelastic
      behaviour of alpha-ammonium carbamate. Both phases show a high-degree of
      anisotropy; in particular, alpha-ammonium carbamate shows unusual compressive
      behaviour, being determined to have negative linear compressibility (NLC) along
      its a axis above 5 GPa. The thermodynamically stable phase at ambient pressure is
      the alpha-polymorph, with a calculated enthalpy difference with respect to the
      beta-polymorph of 0.399 kJ mol(-1); a transition to the beta-polymorph could
      occur at approximately 0.4 GPa.

AB  - This study evaluates the corrosion inhibition property of the aqueous and
      alcoholic leaf extracts of the medicinal plant Ayapana triplinervis. The major
      components in the extracts are thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (THQ) and
      coumarin. It is clear from the weight-loss studies that the water extract of the 
      leaves (AYW) is superior to the alcoholic extract (AYA) in terms of offering
      corrosion inhibition. The 96% efficiency of 4% (v/v) AYW in 0.5 N HCl at room
      temperature changes to 84.62% at 323 K. The mixed-type inhibition behaviour of
      AYW shows slight dominance in the anodic direction. Studies suggest the
      multilayer adsorption of phytochemicals on the metal surface and that the
      adsorption follows the Temkin model. Theoretical studies using DFT and BIOVIA
      Materials Studio investigations establish THQ as a good inhibitor with high
      adsorption characteristics. Even though the concentration of coumarin in the
      extract is low, its presence in the extract facilitates the adsorption of THQ on 
      the metal surface, which is evident from the MD simulation study. The changes in 
      the surface topography and elemental composition of the metal specimen in the
      inhibited and uninhibited solution are monitored by SEM and EDX spectral studies.
      XPS data support the presence of both THQ and coumarin on the metal surface and
      the existence of co-ordinate bonding between the metal's d orbital and the O
      atoms of THQ. Theoretical and experimental studies support the mixed mode of
      adsorption of THQ as physisorption followed by chemisorption.

      Epilepsies in children, young people and adults: Evidence review K
AB  - Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with early onset,
      presenting in the first year of life. Presentation is usually with reoccurring
      fever related prolonged hemiclonic seizures with afebrile generalised tonic
      clinic seizures, myoclonic seizures and absence seizures. Children are
      developmentally normal prior to seizure onset but development begins to slow from
      18 months and severe learning disability, impaired language, impaired mobility
      and feeding develop over time. The majority of patients (85%) have a mutation in 
      SCN1A sodium channel gene, although SCN1A mutations can also be associated with
      less severe forms of epilepsy, such as generalised epilepsy with febrile seizures
      (GEFS). The aim of this review is to determine which antiseizure therapies
      (monotherapy or add-on) are effective in the treatment of seizures in Dravet
      syndrome.

      (K,Na)NbO3-based piezoceramics.
PG  - 3434
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31158-x [doi]
AB  - Here, we introduce phase change mechanisms in lead-free piezoceramics as a
      strategy to utilize attendant volume change for harvesting large electrostrain.
      In the newly developed (K,Na)NbO3 solid-solution at the polymorphic phase
      boundary we combine atomic mapping of the local polar vector with in situ
      synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density functional theory to uncover the phase 
      change and interpret its underlying nature. We demonstrate that an electric
      field-induced phase transition between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases
      triggers a dramatic volume change and contributes to a huge effective
      piezoelectric coefficient of 1250 pm V(-1) along specific crystallographic
      directions. The existence of the phase transition is validated by a significant
      volume change evidenced by the simultaneous recording of macroscopic longitudinal
      and transverse strain. The principle of using phase transition to promote
      electrostrain provides broader design flexibility in the development of
      high-performance piezoelectric materials and opens the door for the discovery of 
      high-performance future functional oxides.

      fibrillation patients with bioprosthetic valve.
PG  - e0268113
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-vitamin K direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is effective for
      prevention of embolic events in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.
      However, the effectiveness and safety of DOAC in AF patients who have
      bioprosthetic heart valve (BPHV) is largely unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      identified patients with AF and BPHV, using the diagnostic code and medical
      device and surgery information from the Korean National Health Insurance Service 
      database, between 2013 and 2018. A 1:2 propensity score-matched cohort (n = 724
      taking warfarin; n = 362 taking DOAC) was constructed and analyzed for the
      primary clinical outcome, a composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism.
      Important secondary outcomes included major bleeding, all-cause death, and the
      net clinical outcome, defined as a composite of all embolic events, major
      bleeding, and death. RESULTS: The mean age was 78.9+/-6.8 years old, and 45% (n =
      489) were male. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.7+/-1.4. DOAC was non-inferior 
      to warfarin for preventing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (hazard ratio
      [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-2.34), major bleeding (HR 0.80, 95% 
      CI 0.32-2.03) and all-cause death (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73-1.63). As for the net
      clinical outcome, DOAC was also similar to warfarin (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76-1.47). 
      These outcomes were not different in various subgroups analyzed. CONCLUSION: In
      this nationwide Korean AF population with a BPHV, DOAC was at least as effective 
      and safe as warfarin for the prevention of systemic embolic events. These results
      suggest that DOAC may be an excellent alternative to warfarin in AF patients with
      BPHV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since March 2020, COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted
      communities of color within the United States. As schools have shifted from
      virtual to in-person learning, continual guidance is necessary to understand
      appropriate interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Weekly testing of
      students and staff for SARS-CoV-2 within K-12 school setting could provide an
      additional barrier to school-based transmission, especially within schools unable
      to implement additional mitigation strategies and/or are in areas of high
      transmission. This study seeks to understand the role that weekly SARS-CoV-2
      testing could play in K-12 schools. In addition, through qualitative interviews
      and listening sessions, this research hopes to understand community concerns and 
      barriers regarding COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 vaccine, and return to school
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS/DESIGN: Sixteen middle and high schools
      from five school districts have been randomized into one of the following
      categories: (1) Weekly screening + symptomatic testing or (2) Symptomatic testing
      only. The primary outcome for this study will be the average of the secondary
      attack rate of school-based transmission per case. School-based transmission will
      also be assessed through qualitative contact interviews with positive contacts
      identified by the school contact tracers. Lastly, new total numbers of weekly
      cases and contacts within a school-based quarantine will provide guidance on
      transmission rates. Qualitative focus groups and interviews have been conducted
      to provide additional understanding to the acceptance of the intervention and
      barriers faced by the community regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination.
      DISCUSSION: This study will provide greater understanding of the benefit that
      weekly screening testing can provide in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission within
      K-12 schools. Close collaboration with community partners and school districts
      will be necessary for the success of this and similar studies. TRIAL

TI  - The transcription factor OsMYBc and an E3 ligase regulate expression of a K+
      transporter during salt stress.
LID - kiac283 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiac283 [doi]
AB  - Na+ and K+ homeostasis is essential for plant survival in saline soils. A member 
      of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family in rice (Oryza sativa),
      OsHKT1;1, is a vital regulator of Na+ exclusion from shoots and is bound by a MYB
      transcription factor (OsMYBc). Here, we generated transgenic rice lines in the
      oshkt1;1 mutant background for genetic complementation using genomic OsHKT1;1
      containing a native (Com) or mutated (mCom) promoter that cannot be bound by
      OsMYBc. In contrast to wild-type (WT) or Com lines, the mCom lines were not able 
      to recover the salt-sensitive phenotype of oshkt1;1. The OsMYBc-overexpressing
      plants were more tolerant to salt stress than WT plants. A yeast two-hybrid
      screen using the OsMYBc N terminus as bait identified a rice MYBc stress-related 
      RING finger protein (OsMSRFP). OsMSRFP is an active E3 ligase that ubiquitinated 
      OsMYBc in vitro and mediated 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsMYBc under 
      semi-in vitro and in vivo conditions. OsMSRFP attenuated OsMYBc-mediated OsHKT1;1
      expression, and knockout of OsMSRFP led to rice salt tolerance. These findings
      uncover a regulatory mechanism of salt response that fine-tunes OsHKT1;1
      transcription by ubiquitination of OsMYBc.

TI  - Facile Strategy for Preparing a Rosin-Based Low-k Material: Molecular Design of
      Free Volume.
PG  - 2856-2866
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00280 [doi]
AB  - Low-k dielectrics are urgently needed in modern integrated circuits. The
      introduction of free volume instead of porous structures has become a powerful
      strategy to reduce the k value. According to this strategy, the biomass resource 
      rosin-containing hydrogenated phenanthrene ring was introduced into
      benzocyclobutene (BCB) resin to reduce the k value; then a rosin-based BCB
      monomer was successfully synthesized. Meanwhile, the BCB monomer without a rosin 
      skeleton was prepared. After converting the monomers into thermo-crosslinked
      materials, notably that the rosin skeleton has a great influence on the free
      volume and k value of the material. The fractional free volume and k value of the
      former are 26% and 2.44, respectively, and those of the latter are 14% and 2.84, 
      respectively. In addition, the distances between molecular chains and the density
      of the former are 0.60 nm and 1.06 g cm(-3), respectively; those of the latter
      are 0.56 nm and 1.28 g cm(-3), respectively. These data show that introducing
      hydrogenated phenanthrene rings occupies part of the space and hinders the
      packing of molecular chains, which increases the distance between molecular
      chains and reduces the density of the polymer, resulting in an increasing free
      volume and a reducing k value. Notably that introducing hydrogenated phenanthrene
      rings cannot affect other properties of the material. Therefore, this research
      indicates that introducing rosin skeletons can prepare high-performance
      materials, which provide some promising low-k materials for the development of
      electronics and microelectronics.

TI  - K-Space Data Reconstruction Algorithm-Based MRI Diagnosis and Influencing Factors
      of Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury.
PG  - 1711456
LID - 10.1155/2022/1711456 [doi]
AB  - This study was aimed at investigating the diagnostic value of MRI based on
      K-space data reconstruction algorithm for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
      of knee joint and the influencing factors of ligament injury. 96 patients with
      ACL injury of knee joint were selected, and they were randomly divided into two
      groups: group A (arthroscopy) and group B (MRI examination), and another 96
      healthy volunteers in the same period were selected as the control group. The
      test results of each indicator were compared. The results showed that the
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SMASH algorithm was higher than that of sum of
      squares (SOS) algorithm. In group A, there were 66 positive and 30 negative
      tests, and in group B, there were 56 positive and 40 negative tests (P < 0.05).
      The intercondylar fossa width, the intercondylar fossa width index, and the ratio
      of tibial intercondylar eminence width to intercondylar fossa width in group B
      were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the
      traditional SOS algorithm, SMASH algorithm can improve the image quality, reduce 
      the impact of damage data on the final synthesis image, and improve the image
      SNR. In clinical work, the ratio of the width of tibial intercondylar eminence to
      the width of femoral intercondylar fossa can be measured by imaging data to
      evaluate the matching between tibial intercondylar eminence and femoral
      intercondylar fossa, so as to evaluate the risk of ACL rupture.

TI  - Fault Detection and Isolation of Non-Gaussian and Nonlinear Processes Based on
      Statistics Pattern Analysis and the k-Nearest Neighbor Method.

AB  - Only low-order information of process data (i.e., mean, variance, and covariance)
      was considered in the principal component analysis (PCA)-based process monitoring
      method. Consequently, it cannot deal with continuous processes with strong
      dynamics, nonlinearity, and non-Gaussianity. To this aim, the statistics pattern 
      analysis (SPA)-based process monitoring method achieves better monitoring results
      by extracting higher-order statistics (HOS) of the process variables. However,
      the extracted statistics do not strictly follow a Gaussian distribution, making
      the estimated control limits in Hotelling-T (2) and squared prediction error
      (SPE) charts inaccurate, resulting in unsatisfactory monitoring performance. In
      order to solve this problem, this paper presents a novel process monitoring
      method using SPA and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In the proposed method,
      first, the statistics of process variables are calculated through SPA. Then, the 
      k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method is used to monitor the extracted statistics. The 
      kNN method only uses the paired distance of samples to perform fault detection.
      It has no strict requirements for data distribution. Hence, the proposed method
      can overcome the problems caused by the non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity of
      statistics. In addition, the potential of the proposed method in early fault
      detection or safety alarm and fault isolation is explored. The proposed method
      can isolate which variable or its statistic is faulty. Finally, the numerical
      examples and Tennessee Eastman benchmark process illustrate the effectiveness of 
      the proposed method.

PG  - 911056
LID - 10.3389/fcell.2022.911056 [doi]
AB  - The Na,K-ATPase alpha 4 isoform (NKAalpha4) is expressed specifically in the male
      germ cells of the testes and is particularly abundant in mature spermatozoa.
      Genetic deletion of NKAalpha4 in mice (NKAalpha4 KO mice) results in complete
      infertility of male, but not female mice. The reduced fecundity of NKAalpha4 KO
      male mice is due to a series of defects, including a severe impairment in total
      and hyperactive sperm motility. In this work, we show that deletion of NKAalpha4 
      also leads to major defects in sperm metabolism and energetics. Thus, compared to
      wild-type sperm, sperm from NKAalpha4 KO mice display a significant reduction in 
      the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), indicative of impaired glycolytic
      flux. In addition, mitochondrial function is disrupted in sperm lacking
      NKAalpha4, as indicated by a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential
      and lower oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Moreover, the ratio between the oxidized
      and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD/NADH) is increased in
      NKAalpha4 KO sperm, indicating a shift in the cellular redox state. These
      metabolic changes are associated with augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      production and increased lipid peroxidation in NKAalpha4 KO sperm. Altogether,
      these findings reveal a novel link between NKAalpha4 activity and sperm
      energetics, highlighting the essential role of this ion transporter in sperm
      physiology.

AB  - This study examines how policy directives and recommendations implemented during 
      a massive universal Pre-Kindergarten expansion in New York City has impacted
      teachers' professional identity. We adapted the critical ecologies of the early
      childhood profession by Dalli et al. (Early childhood grows up: Towards a
      critical ecology of the profession. In Early childhood grows up, Springer,
      Dordrecht, pp. 3-19, 2012) and utilized data from in-depth interviews with
      teachers at community-based organizations in Pre-K programs. Our thematic
      analysis of transcripts revealed three themes in relation to teachers'
      professional identity: becoming a teacher who can play multiple roles to meet
      administration's expectations is necessary; continuously modifying practice based
      on external support from the leadership and policymakers can be confusing; and
      having a brand new relationship with administrative bodies presents challenges.
      Data drawn from these themes reveal external factors that have influence over
      teachers' professional identity. As there is heightened attention toward publicly
      funding early childhood in the U.S., and the need for a respected workforce, the 
      implications of this work includes seeking out teachers' voices to meet their
      localized needs to support healthy professional identity development while they
      adjust their practice in response to the policy change.

TI  - The Repression of Matrix Metalloproteinases and Cytokine Secretion in
      Glioblastoma by Targeting K+ Channel.
PG  - 737-744
LID - 10.32598/bcn.2021.1693.1 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Glioblastoma is an aggressive human brain malignancy with poorly
      understood pathogenesis. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are highly expressed in malignant tumors and involved
      in the progression and metastasis of glioblastoma. This study aimed to determine 
      whether a voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker could modulate astrocytes
      as a cell involved in the immunopathogenesis of glioblastoma. Methods: The
      cytotoxic effect of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) at different doses in the cell model
      of glioblastoma was measured by MTT assay. The ELISA technique and gelatin
      zymography were used to assess cytokine levels and MMP-9 after 4-AP treatment.
      Results: Cytotoxicity analysis data indicated that cell viability reduced by
      increasing 4-AP level and cell growth decreased gradually by removing 4-AP from
      the cell medium. 4-AP inhibits the secretion of IL-6 and IL-1 (P<0.05). MMP9
      activity significantly inhibits with increased 4-AP dose, compared to non-treated
      cells. Conclusion: The reduction of cell viability, IL-6 secretion, and MMP-9
      activity in an in vitro model of glioblastoma might be assumed 4-AP as an agent
      for chemoprevention of cancer. Highlights: 4-Aminopyridine, as a K channel
      blocker, inhibits the secretion of IL-1.A voltage-gated potassium channel
      inhibits the secretion of IL-6.MMP9 activity, as a tumor metastasis marker,
      significantly decreased by 4-AP. Plain Language Summary: Glioblastoma is the most
      common primary malignant of the brain, which remains mainly untreatable. A group 
      of enzymes -matrix metalloproteinases- can digest various extracellular matrix
      macromolecules. They express at a high level and play a role in the glioblastoma 
      invasion. Besides, several substances are secreted by multiple cells and affect
      cancer metastasis. Among them, cytokines, like interleukin-6, released from glial
      cells, may contribute to glioblastoma progression. The present study determined
      whether an agent as a potassium channel blocker could modulate the
      immunopathogenesis of glioblastoma. We realized the cytotoxic effect of potassium
      channel blocker at different doses in the U-373 MG glioblastoma astrocytoma
      cells. Our chosen agent inhibits the secretion of both interleukin and matrix
      metalloproteinases activity. Overall, we suggest potassium channel blocker as an 
      agent for cancer chemoprevention.

LID - 10.53854/liim-3002-14 [doi]
AB  - Meropenem/vaborbactam (M/V) is a new carbapenem-carbapenemase inhibitor
      combination drug active against extensively drug resistant Gram-negative
      pathogens. Studies about its efficacy and place in therapy are limited in
      "real-life" and no data are available for deep site infections, like vascular
      graft infections. We present a case of a patient successfully treated with M/V
      for a thoracic aorta graft infection, placed for a traumatic penetrating aortic
      ulcer, due to an extensively KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to
      ceftazidime/ avibactam. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic literature review 
      concerning vascular graft infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and the papers published until now about the use of M/V for the
      treatment of ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant K. pneumoniae. Meropenem/vaborbactam
      is a promising antibiotic for difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria with
      limited therapeutic options. Only few reports have been published and more
      studies are needed to assess which is the best place in therapy of M/V.

TI  - Real-time cardiac MRI using an undersampled spiral k-space trajectory and a
      reconstruction based on a variational network.
LID - 10.1002/mrm.29357 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiac MRI represents the gold standard to determine myocardial
      function. However, the current clinical standard protocol, a segmented Cartesian 
      acquisition, is time-consuming and can lead to compromised image quality in the
      case of arrhythmia or dyspnea. In this article, a machine learning-based
      reconstruction of undersampled spiral k-space data is presented to enable free
      breathing real-time cardiac MRI with good image quality and short reconstruction 
      times. METHODS: Data were acquired in free breathing with a 2D spiral trajectory 
      corrected by the gradient system transfer function. Undersampled data were
      reconstructed by a variational network (VN), which was specifically adapted to
      the non-Cartesian sampling pattern. The network was trained with data from 11
      subjects. Subsequently, the imaging technique was validated in 14 subjects by
      quantifying the difference to a segmented reference acquisition, an expert reader
      study, and by comparing derived volumes and functional parameters with values
      obtained using the current clinical gold standard. RESULTS: The scan time for the
      entire heart was below 1 min. The VN reconstructed data in about 0.9 s per image,
      which is considerably shorter than conventional model-based approaches. The VN
      furthermore performed better than a U-Net and not inferior to a low-rank plus
      sparse model in terms of achieved image quality. Functional parameters agreed, on
      average, with reference data. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed VN method enables
      real-time cardiac imaging with both high spatial and temporal resolution in free 
      breathing and with short reconstruction time.

AB  - Building a proper flexible electrode with high cycling stability, rate capacity
      and initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) for flexible potassium-ion batteries
      (PIBs) remains a challenge. Herein, nitrogen/phosphorus co-doped carbon coated
      FeP nanorods arrays on carbon cloth (FeP@N, PC NRs/CC) as high-rate capable
      flexible self-supporting anode was successfully fabricated. The composite
      electrode combines the advantages of FeP nanorods arrays (FeP NRs), carbon cloth 
      (CC) and N, P co-doped carbon shell (N, P-C), which comprehensively improves the 
      electrochemical stability of the flexible electrode, while the open space between
      FeP nanorods can facilitate electrolyte impregnation and enhance K(+) transfer,
      thus effectively elevating the corresponding rate capability. For the FeP@N, PC
      NRs/CC electrode, it delivers a reversible capacity of 388.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A 
      g(-1) up to 400 cycles. Even at 1.5 A g(-1), it can still achieve a remarkable
      rate capacity of 346.9 mA h g(-1). Moreover, the assembled soft-packed cell can
      always light the LED lights when it is bent at different angles, which exhibits
      excellent mechanical flexibility.

AB  - In this letter to the editor, we respond to a recent article by colleagues
      Fornai, Tester, Parlett, Basili, and Costa that is devoted entirely to
      criticizing our article entitled "Centric relation critically revisited - What
      are the clinical implications? (J Oral Rehabil 2021;48:1050-1055). We conclude
      that the objections of the above authors are unfounded, because our article was
      based on a mountain of basic and clinical evidence in support of the positions we
      presented there.

      (K-LOLAC), Collaborative Study: Final Action 2020.08.
LID - qsac070 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jaoacint/qsac070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The AOAC Stakeholder Panel on Strategic Food Analytical Methods
      issued a call for methods in 2018 for the measurement of lactose in low-lactose
      and lactose-free products under Standard Method Performance Requirements
      (SMPR(R)) 2018.009. Megazyme's Lactose Assay Kit (K-LOLAC) was reviewed and
      accepted as a First Action Official Method in 2020 (2020.08). OBJECTIVE: A
      collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the to evaluate the reproducibility
      of AOAC Method 2020.08 for the measurement of lactose concentration in
      low-lactose and lactose-free milk, milk products, and products containing dairy
      ingredients. METHOD: Samples are deproteinated and clarified by treatment with
      Carrez reagents, then free glucose is removed using a glucose oxidase and
      catalase treatment system. Quantification of lactose is based on the hydrolytic
      activity of beta-galactosidase, which hydrolyses lactose to glucose and
      galactose. Any remaining free D-glucose is first measured using a Hexokinase
      (HK)/Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PDH)/6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 
      (6-PGDH) based assay procedure, and then beta-galactosidase is added to hydrolyse
      the lactose in the same reaction vessel with concurrent measurement of the
      released D-glucose. The samples analysed included a number of lactose free and
      low-lactose milk samples, lactose-free infant formula, lactose-free milkshake,
      lactose-free adult nutritional drink, lactose-free cream and lactose-free cheese.
      RESULTS: All materials had repeatability relative standard deviations (RSDr) <7%.
      The reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR) varied from 3.8 to 14.9%
      with seven of the 10 test samples having an RSDR of < 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Lactose Assay Kit (K-LOLAC) meets the requirements for reproducibility set out
      under SMPR 2018.009. HIGHLIGHTS: The Lactose Assay (K-LOLAC) is a robust, simple 
      and reproducible method for analysis of lactose in foodstuffs and beverages.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of vitamin-K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants for
      stroke prevention in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm: an updated
      systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.
PG  - 17474930221109149
LID - 10.1177/17474930221109149 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart failure is a major public health issue associated with
      significantly increased risk of stroke. It remains uncertain whether oral
      anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm (HF-SR)
      could improve prognosis. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed and 
      Embase databases for randomized controlled clinical trials assessing oral
      anticoagulants versus antiplatelets or placebo in patients with heart failure or 
      ventricular dysfunction/cardiomyopathy without clinical heart failure, and sinus 
      rhythm. The outcomes assessed were stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding,
      myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalization.
      RESULTS: Seven trials of 15,794 patients were eligible for our analyses. The
      overall follow-up duration was 32,367 patient-years corresponding to a mean
      follow-up of 2.05 years per patient. Four trials included patients treated with
      warfarin and three included patients treated with rivaroxaban. Oral
      anticoagulation was associated with reduced rate of stroke or systemic embolism
      compared to control (OR:0.57, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.82, NNT: 65.1) but higher rate of
      major bleeding (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.63, NNH: 58.1). In the subgroup
      analysis according to the type of OAC, rivaroxaban was associated with
      significantly reduced rate of stroke or systemic embolism (1.24 vs. 1.97 events
      per 100 patient-years, respectively, OR:0.63, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.88, NNT: 82)
      without excess risk of major bleeding (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.26, 10.59) compared to
      antiplatelets or placebo. There was no significant differences between groups for
      the outcomes of myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and heart failure
      hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that a non-VKA strategy of oral
      anticoagulation may be both efficacious and safe for stroke prevention in HF-SR
      patients. A well-designed randomized controlled trial of newer safer OACs is
      needed in this population.

      an important medicinal plant used to treat various ailments. In this study, we
      report the antiurolithiatic, antioxidant, and antibacterial potential of
      chloroform fraction (CF) from P. gangeticus roots. For the chemical profiling,
      HPTLC, FT-IR, and GC-MS techniques of the CF were carried out, and phytochemical 
      investigation was revealed that stigmasterol (45.06%) is one of the major
      components present in the fraction. The nucleation and aggregation assays were
      used to evaluate the in vitro antiurolithiatic activity at various concentration 
      (2-10 mg/mL) of the CF. The results showed that the chloroform fraction had
      dose-dependent effects on Calcium Oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation. In both the
      assays, the maximum concentration of 10 mg/mL has shown better results. This
      concentration resulted significant increase in CaOx crystal nucleation along with
      the reduction of crystal size and the inhibition of crystal aggregation. Further,
      the CF showed stronger antioxidant (DPPH, NO, SOD, TRC) potential with an IC50
      values of 415.9327, 391.729, 275.971, and 419.14 microg/mL, respectively. The
      antibacterial evaluation displayed effective results in the Agar well diffusion
      assay against selective urinary tract infection (UTI) pathogens (Escherichia
      coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus). A maximum zone of
      inhibition (ZOI) 12.33 +/- 1.05 mm for K pneumonia and minimum ZOI of 8.46 +/-
      0.27 mm for S. aureus were obtained. Further, the ADME-PK property of the
      stigmasterol was investigated, and it was found to pass the Lipinski and Ghose
      rules, supporting the drug-likeliness. This is the first record of the
      antiurolithiatic potential of P. gangeticus along with antioxidant and
      antibacterial activities. These findings give an insight into the effective drug 
      development and treatment for kidney stones in future.

TI  - Comparison of utility of deep learning reconstruction on 3D MRCPs obtained with
      three different k-space data acquisitions in patients with IPMN.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08877-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the utility of deep learning reconstruction (DLR) for
      improving acquisition time, image quality, and intraductal papillary mucinous
      neoplasm (IPMN) evaluation for 3D MRCP obtained with parallel imaging (PI),
      multiple k-space data acquisition for each repetition time (TR) technique (Fast
      3D mode multiple: Fast 3Dm) and compressed sensing (CS) with PI. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 32 IPMN patients who had undergone 3D MRCPs obtained with PI,
      Fast 3Dm, and CS with PI and reconstructed with and without DLR were
      retrospectively included in this study. Acquisition time, signal-to-noise ratio
      (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) obtained with all protocols were
      compared using Tukey's HSD test. Results of endoscopic ultrasound, ERCP, surgery,
      or pathological examination were determined as standard reference, and
      distribution classifications were compared among all 3D MRCP protocols by
      McNemar's test. RESULTS: Acquisition times of Fast 3Dm and CS with PI with and
      without DLR were significantly shorter than those of PI with and without DLR (p <
      0.05). Each MRCP sequence with DLR showed significantly higher SNRs and CNRs than
      those without DLR (p < 0.05). IPMN distribution accuracy of PI with and without
      DLR and Fast 3Dm with DLR was significantly higher than that of Fast 3Dm without 
      DLR and CS with PI without DLR (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DLR is useful for
      improving image quality and IPMN evaluation capability on 3D MRCP obtained with
      PI, Fast 3Dm, or CS with PI. Moreover, Fast 3Dm and CS with PI may play as
      substitution to PI for MRCP in patients with IPMN. KEY POINTS: * Mean examination
      times of multiple k-space data acquisitions for each TR and compressed sensing
      with parallel imaging were significantly shorter than that of parallel imaging (p
      < 0.0001). * When comparing image quality of 3D MRCPs with and without deep
      learning reconstruction, deep learning reconstruction significantly improved
      signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio (p < 0.05). * IPMN distribution
      accuracies of parallel imaging with and without deep learning reconstruction
      (with vs. without: 88.0% vs. 88.0%) and multiple k-space data acquisitions for
      each TR with deep learning reconstruction (86.0%) were significantly higher than 
      those of others (p < 0.05).

TI  - Anticoagulation Control in Older Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving Vitamin K
      Antagonist Therapy for Stroke Prevention.
PG  - 5951262
LID - 10.1155/2022/5951262 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Efficacy and safety of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) among atrial
      fibrillation (AF) patients are enhanced when the International Normalised Ratio
      (INR) is 2.0-3.0. Anticoagulation control among older patients is perceived to be
      lower and contributes to poorer initiation and uptake. Objective: To examine the 
      quality of INR control, adverse clinical outcomes, and factors associated with
      bleeding in older AF patients (>/=80 years). Methods: Anticoagulation control
      assessed by time in therapeutic range (TTR) (Rosendaal method) and percentage
      INRs in range (PINRR). Among the 205 patients aged >/=80 years, 58.5% were
      female, with mean (SD) CHA2DS2-VASc 4.4 (1.3) and HAS-BLED 1.8 (0.8) scores.
      Results: Mean (SD) TTR and PINRR were similar for those aged >/=80 vs. <80 years 
      (66.7 (13.8) vs. 66.7 (13.1)) despite significantly lower INR monitoring
      intensity (51.2 (22.7) vs. 60.7 (25.8)) and shorter follow-up (4.4 (2.6-6.2) vs. 
      5.7 years (3.3-7.1)) in those >/=80 years of age. Good anticoagulation control
      (TTR and PINRR >/=70%) of 44% was seen in both age groups. No significant
      differences in composite major adverse clinical events were evident for those
      aged >/=80 vs. <80 years (p = 0.55). Cox regression analysis confirmed that age
      >/=80 years was associated with higher risk of bleeding (HR 1.90 (1.01-3.56); p =
      0.047). Conclusions: Suboptimal (TTR and PINRR <70%) anticoagulation control was 
      evident in all patients. Risk of bleeding increased, but there was no difference 
      in thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality in those aged >/=80 years.
      Improving TTR to >/=70% and enhancing anticoagulation monitoring of VKA use
      remain a clinical priority to prevent bleeding complications, particularly among 
      those aged 80 years and above.

      Radiological Outcomes in the Metaizeau Closed Reduction Technique.
PG  - 9317837
LID - 10.1155/2022/9317837 [doi]
AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of using Kirschner-wire
      (K-wire) or titanium elastic nails (TEN) on the functional results of patients
      treated with the Metaizeau closed reduction technique, which is a popular
      treatment modality for pediatric radial neck fractures (PRNF). Methods: Patients 
      who underwent the Metaizeau closed reduction technique for PRNF between May 2017 
      and May 2019 were assessed retrospectively. The Judet classification was used for
      the PRNF classification. The study consisted of patients who underwent the
      Metaizeau technique for Judet Type IV PRNFs and had at least 12 months of
      follow-up. Results: This study enrolled a total of 43 patients, 22 females and 21
      males. Their mean age was 8.69 +/- 2.3 at the time of surgery. The mean MEPS of
      patients undergoing K-wire surgery was 89.50, while the mean MEPS of patients
      undergoing TEN surgery was 92.83. There was no statistically significant
      difference between the two groups in terms of MEPS. When the complication rates
      of the two groups were evaluated, there was no statistically significant
      difference between them. The cost per patient for TEN was $40. The cost per
      patient for the K-wire was $1. Conclusion: The effect of K-wire or TEN used in
      the Metaizeau closed reduction technique on clinical outcomes is similar, and
      K-wire is more cost-effective.

TI  - Does vitamin K supplementation improve vitamin K antagonist therapy? A case
      report and update of the literature.
PG  - 359-362
LID - 10.1016/j.jccase.2021.12.011 [doi]
AB  - We report a multi-morbid patient with mechanical aortic valve and unstable and
      sub-therapeutic levels of international normalized ratio (INR), initially in
      phenprocoumon and later in warfarin therapy. All efforts, including self-testing 
      using Point of Care Testing with telemedicine support to stabilize the patient's 
      INR within the therapeutic range, were unsuccessful. Since INR fluctuations can
      occur due to poor or varied dietary vitamin K, 180 mug/day vitamin K was added to
      the patient's warfarin treatment in an attempt to stabilize INR fluctuations.
      Three weeks later INR was in therapeutic range and remained within range for two 
      consecutive months suggesting beneficial effect of vitamin K. Our updated
      literature review demonstrates that vitamin K supplementation can improve the
      stability of INR without improvement of time therapeutic range. <Learning
      objective: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is the only approved anticoagulation
      therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves. The quality of anticoagulation 
      therapy in some of these patients is challenged. There is insufficient evidence
      to advise routine vitamin K supplementation to all patients receiving VKA
      treatment. Supplementation, however, could be considered in patients with

TI  - Unveiling the Origin of Alkali Metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) Promotion in CO2
      Dissociation over Mo2C Catalysts.
LID - 3775 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma15113775 [doi]
AB  - Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) is a promising and low-cost catalyst for the reverse
      water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Doping the Mo2C surface with alkali metals can
      improve the activity of CO2 conversion, but the effect of these metals on CO2
      conversion to CO remains poorly understood. In this study, the energies of CO2
      dissociation and CO desorption on the Mo2C surface in the presence of different
      alkali metals (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) are calculated using density functional theory 
      (DFT). Alkali metal doping results in increasing electron density on the Mo atoms
      and promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2 on Mo2C; the dissociation
      barrier of CO2 is decreased from 12.51 on Mo2C surfaces to 9.51-11.21 Kcal/mol on
      alkali metal-modified Mo2C surfaces. Energetic and electronic analyses reveal
      that although the alkali metals directly bond with oxygen atoms of the oxides,
      the reduction in the energy of CO2 dissociation can be attributed to the
      increased interaction between CO/O fragments and Mo in the transition states. The
      abilities of four alkali metals (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) to promote CO2 dissociation
      increase in the order Na (11.21 Kcal/mol) &lt; Rb (10.54 Kcal/mol) &lt; Cs (10.41
      Kcal/mol) &lt; K (9.51 Kcal/mol). Through electronic analysis, it is found that
      the increased electron density on the Mo atoms is a result of the alkali metal,
      and a greater negative charge on Mo results in a lower energy barrier for CO2
      dissociation.

TI  - Transcription Factor SrsR (YgfI) Is a Novel Regulator for the Stress-Response
      Genes in Stationary Phase in Escherichia coli K-12.
LID - 6055 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23116055 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the functional information of all genes and the biological
      mechanism based on the comprehensive genome regulation mechanism is an important 
      task in life science. YgfI is an uncharacterized LysR family transcription factor
      in Escherichia coli. To identify the function of YgfI, the genomic SELEX (gSELEX)
      screening was performed for YgfI regulation targets on the E. coli genome. In
      addition, regulatory and phenotypic analyses were performed. A total of 10 loci
      on the E. coli genome were identified as the regulatory targets of YgfI with the 
      YgfI binding activity. These predicted YgfI target genes were involved in biofilm
      formation, hydrogen peroxide resistance, and antibiotic resistance, many of which
      were expressed in the stationary phase. The TCAGATTTTGC sequence was identified
      as an YgfI box in in vitro gel shift assay and DNase-I footprinting assays.
      RT-qPCR analysis in vivo revealed that the expression of YgfI increased in the
      stationary phase. Physiological analyses suggested the participation of YgfI in
      biofilm formation and an increase in the tolerability against hydrogen peroxide. 
      In summary, we propose to rename ygfI as srsR (a stress-response regulator in
      stationary phase).

TI  - Identification of different proteins binding to Na, K-ATPase alpha1 in
      LPS-induced ARDS cell model by proteomic analysis.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s12953-022-00193-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by
      refractory hypoxemia caused by accumulation of pulmonary fluid, which is related 
      to inflammatory cell infiltration, impaired tight junction of pulmonary
      epithelium and impaired Na, K-ATPase function, especially Na, K-ATPase alpha1
      subunit. Up until now, the pathogenic mechanism at the level of protein during
      lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced ARDS remains unclear. METHODS: Using an
      unbiased, discovery and quantitative proteomic approach, we discovered the
      differentially expressed proteins binding to Na, K-ATPase alpha1 between LPS-A549
      cells and Control-A549 cells. These Na, K-ATPase alpha1 interacting proteins were
      screened by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) technology. Among them, some of the
      differentially expressed proteins with significant performance were identified
      and quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data
      are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032209. The protein
      interaction network was constructed by the related Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Several differentially
      expressed proteins were validated by Western blot. RESULTS: Of identified 1598
      proteins, 89 were differentially expressed proteins between LPS-A549 cells and
      Control-A549 cells. Intriguingly, protein-protein interaction network showed that
      there were 244 significantly enriched co-expression among 60 proteins in the
      group control-A549. while the group LPS-A549 showed 43 significant enriched
      interactions among 29 proteins. The related GO and KEGG analysis found evident
      phenomena of ubiquitination and deubiquitination, as well as the pathways related
      to autophagy. Among proteins with rich abundance, there were several intriguing
      ones, including the deubiquitinase (OTUB1), the tight junction protein zonula
      occludens-1 (ZO-1), the scaffold protein in CUL4B-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B)
      complexes (CUL4B) and the autophagy-related protein sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1).
      CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our proteomic approach revealed targets related to
      the occurrence and development of ARDS, being the first study to investigate
      significant differences in Na, K-ATPase alpha1 interacting proteins between
      LPS-induced ARDS cell model and control-A549 cell. These proteins may help the
      clinical diagnosis and facilitate the personalized treatment of ARDS.

PG  - 3232
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-30853-z [doi]
AB  - TWIK1 (K2P1.1, KCNK1) is a widely expressed pH-gated two-pore domain K(+) channel
      (K2P) that contributes to cardiac rhythm generation and insulin release from
      pancreatic beta cells. TWIK1 displays unique properties among K2Ps including low 
      basal activity and inhibition by extracellular protons through incompletely
      understood mechanisms. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of TWIK1 in lipid
      nanodiscs at high and low pH that reveal a previously undescribed gating
      mechanism at the K(+) selectivity filter. At high pH, TWIK1 adopts an open
      conformation. At low pH, protonation of an extracellular histidine results in a
      cascade of conformational changes that close the channel by sealing the top of
      the selectivity filter, displacing the helical cap to block extracellular ion
      access pathways, and opening gaps for lipid block of the intracellular cavity.
      These data provide a mechanistic understanding for extracellular pH-gating of
      TWIK1 and illustrate how diverse mechanisms have evolved to gate the selectivity 
      filter of K(+) channels.

TI  - Mechanically Durable Organic/High-k Inorganic Hybrid Gate Dielectrics Enabled by 
      Plasma-Polymerization of PTFE for Flexible Electronics.
PG  - 28085-28096
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c04340 [doi]
AB  - To achieve both the synergistic advantages of outstanding flexibility in organic 
      dielectrics and remarkable dielectric/insulating properties in inorganic
      dielectrics, a plasma-polymerized hafnium oxide (HfOx) hybrid (PPH-hybrid)
      dielectric is proposed. Using a radio-frequency magnetron cosputtering process,
      the high-k HfOx dielectric is plasma-polymerized with polytetrafluoroethylene
      (PTFE), which is a flexible, thermally stable, and hydrophobic fluoropolymer
      dielectric. The PPH-hybrid dielectric with a high dielectric constant of 14.17
      exhibits excellent flexibility, maintaining a leakage current density of
      approximately 10(-8) A/cm(2) even after repetitive bending stress (up to 10000
      bending cycles with a radius of 2 mm), whereas the HfOx dielectric degrades to be
      leaky. To evaluate its practical applicability to flexible thin-film transistors 
      (TFTs), the PPH-hybrid dielectric is applied to amorphous indium-gallium-zinc
      oxide (IGZO) TFTs as a gate dielectric. Consequently, the PPH-hybrid
      dielectric-based IGZO TFTs exhibit stable electrical performance under the same
      harsh bending cycles: a field-effect mobility of 16.99 cm(2)/(V s), an on/off
      current ratio of 1.15 x 10(8), a subthreshold swing of 0.35 V/dec, and a
      threshold voltage of 0.96 V (averaged in nine devices). Moreover, the PPH-hybrid 
      dielectric-based IGZO TFTs exhibit a reduced I-V hysteresis and an enhanced
      positive bias stress stability, with the threshold voltage shift decreasing from 
      4.99 to 1.74 V, due to fluorine incorporation. These results demonstrate that
      PTFE improves both the mechanical durability and electrical stability, indicating
      that the PPH-hybrid dielectric is a promising candidate for high-performance and 
      low-power flexible electronics.

TI  - Ventilation Improvement Strategies Among K-12 Public Schools - The National
      School COVID-19 Prevention Study, United States, February 14-March 27, 2022.
PG  - 770-775
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7123e2 [doi]
AB  - Effective COVID-19 prevention in kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools
      requires multicomponent prevention strategies in school buildings and
      school-based transportation, including improving ventilation (1). Improved
      ventilation can reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and duration of
      potential exposures (2,3), is linked to lower COVID-19 incidence (4), and can
      offer other health-related benefits (e.g., better measures of respiratory health,
      such as reduced allergy symptoms) (5). Whereas ambient wind currents effectively 
      dissipate SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) outdoors,* ventilation
      systems provide protective airflow and filtration indoors (6). CDC examined
      reported ventilation improvement strategies among a nationally representative
      sample of K-12 public schools in the United States using wave 4 (February
      14-March 27, 2022) data from the National School COVID-19 Prevention Study
      (NSCPS) (420 schools), a web-based survey administered to school-level
      administrators beginning in summer 2021.(dagger) The most frequently reported
      ventilation improvement strategies were lower-cost strategies, including
      relocating activities outdoors (73.6%), inspecting and validating existing
      heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems (70.5%), and opening
      doors (67.3%) or windows (67.2%) when safe to do so. A smaller proportion of
      schools reported more resource-intensive strategies such as replacing or
      upgrading HVAC systems (38.5%) or using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)
      filtration systems in classrooms (28.2%) or eating areas (29.8%). Rural and
      mid-poverty-level schools were less likely to report several resource-intensive
      strategies. For example, rural schools were less likely to use portable HEPA
      filtration systems in classrooms (15.6%) than were city (37.7%) and suburban
      schools (32.9%), and mid-poverty-level schools were less likely than were
      high-poverty-level schools to have replaced or upgraded HVAC systems (32.4%
      versus 48.8%). Substantial federal resources to improve ventilation in schools
      are available.( section sign) Ensuring their use might reduce SARS-CoV-2
      transmission in schools. Focusing support on schools least likely to have
      resource-intensive ventilation strategies might facilitate equitable
      implementation of ventilation improvements.

TI  - Analysis and/or Interpretation in Neurophysiology? A Transatlantic Discussion
      Between F. J. J. Buytendijk and K. S. Lashley, 1929-1932.
LID - 10.1007/s10739-022-09680-x [doi]
AB  - In the interwar period, biologists employed a diverse set of holistic approaches 
      that were connected to different research methodologies. Against this background,
      this article explores attempts in the 1920s and 1930s to negotiate quantitative
      and qualitative methods in the field of neurophysiology. It focuses on the work
      of two scientists on different sides of the Atlantic: the Dutch animal
      psychologist and physiologist Frederik J.J. Buytendijk and the American
      neuropsychologist Karl S. Lashley, specifically analyzing their critical
      correspondence, 1929-1932, on the problems surrounding the term intelligence. It 
      discusses the inexplicable anomalies in neurophysiology as well as the
      reliability of quantitative and qualitative methods. While in his laboratory work
      Lashley adhered to a strictly analytic approach, Buytendijk tried to combine
      quantitative methods with phenomenological and hermeneutical approaches. The
      starting point of their discussion is Lashley's monograph on Brain Mechanisms and
      Intelligence (1929) and the rat experiments discussed therein. Buytendijk
      questioned the viability of the maze-learning method and the use of statistics to
      test intelligence in animals; he reproduced Lashley's experiments and then
      confronted Lashley with his critical findings. In addition to elucidating this
      exchange, this paper will, more generally, shed light on the nature of the
      disagreements and shared assumptions prevalent among interwar neurophysiologists.
      In turn, it contributes to historiographical debates on localization and
      functionalism and the discrepancy between analytic (quantitative) and
      interpretative (qualitative) approaches.

AB  - The study is aimed at evaluating corneal epithelial thickness changes associated 
      with overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). In this retrospective study, epithelial
      thickness was measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after 
      1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months ortho-K nightly lens wear. Compared with
      pre-orthokeratology measurements, central (2 mm) corneal epithelium thickness was
      significantly reduced at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months with ortho-K (P <
      0.05). Paracentral (2 mm~5 mm annular ring) epithelial thickness was also
      significantly reduced at superior temporal, inferior temporal, temporal, and
      inferior locations after ortho-K (P < 0.05), while midperipheral (5 mm~6 mm
      annular ring) epithelial thickness was greater post- than pre-ortho-K at
      superior, superior temporal, inferior temporal, inferior, and inferior nasal
      locations (P < 0.05). In other zones, superior, superior nasal, nasal, and
      inferior nasal in paracentral annular ring and temporal and superior nasal in
      midperipheral ring, epithelial thickness underwent no significant change. Ortho-K
      lens wear caused the central corneal epitheliums to thin. The temporal half zones
      become thinner in paracentral zones and thicker in midperipheral zones.

TI  - Blockchain and K-Means Algorithm for Edge AI Computing.
PG  - 1153208
LID - 10.1155/2022/1153208 [doi]
AB  - The current development of blockchain, technically speaking, still faces many key
      problems such as efficiency and scalability issues, and any distributed system
      faces the problem of how to balance consistency, availability, and fault
      tolerance need to be solved urgently. The advantage of blockchain is
      decentralization, and the most important thing in a decentralized system is how
      to make nodes reach a consensus quickly. This research mainly discusses the
      blockchain and K-means algorithm for edge AI computing. The natural pan-central
      distributed trustworthiness of blockchain provides new ideas for designing the
      framework and paradigm of edge AI computing. In edge AI computing, multiple
      devices running AI algorithms are scattered across the edge network. When it
      comes to decentralized management, blockchain is the underlying technology of the
      Bitcoin system. Due to its characteristics of immutability, traceability, and
      consensus mechanism of transaction data storage, it has recently received
      extensive attention. Blockchain technology is essentially a public ledger. This
      is done by recording data related to trust management to this ledger. To
      collaboratively complete artificial intelligence computing tasks or jointly make 
      intelligent group decisions, frequent communication is required between these
      devices. By integrating idle computing resources in an area, a distributed edge
      computing platform is formed. Users obtain benefits by sharing their computing
      resources, and nodes in need complete computing tasks through the shared
      platform. In view of the identity security problems faced in the sharing process,
      this article introduces blockchain technology to realize the trust between users.
      All participants must register a secure identity in the blockchain network and
      conduct transactions in this security system. A K-means algorithm suitable for
      edge environments is proposed to identify different degradation stages of
      equipment operation reflected by multiple types of data. Based on the prediction 
      of the fault state for a single type of data, the algorithm uses the historical
      data of multiple types of data together with the prediction data to predict the
      fault stage. During the research process, the average optimization energy
      consumption of K-means algorithm is 14.6% lower than that of GA. On the basis of 
      designing a resource allocation scheme based on blockchain, the problem of how
      the participants can realize reliable resource use according to the recorded data
      on the chain is studied. The article implements the verification of the legality 
      of the use of blockchain resources. In addition, a control node is introduced to 
      master the global real-time information of the network to provide data support
      for the user's choice.

TI  - Comprehensive identification and characterization of the HERV-K (HML-9) group in 
      the human genome.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s12977-022-00596-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) result from ancestral
      infections caused by exogenous retroviruses that became incorporated into the
      germline DNA and evolutionarily fixed in the human genome. HERVs can be
      transmitted vertically in a Mendelian fashion and be stably maintained in the
      human genome, of which they are estimated to comprise approximately 8%. HERV-K
      (HML1-10) transcription has been confirmed to be associated with a variety of
      diseases, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma,
      rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the poor
      characterization of HML-9 prevents a detailed understanding of the regulation of 
      the expression of this family in humans and its impact on the host genome. In
      light of this, a precise and updated HERV-K HML-9 genomic map is urgently needed 
      to better evaluate the role of these elements in human health. RESULTS: We report
      a comprehensive analysis of the presence and distribution of HERV-K HML-9
      elements within the human genome, with a detailed characterization of the
      structural and phylogenetic properties of the group. A total of 23 proviruses and
      47 solo LTR elements were characterized, with a detailed description of the
      provirus structure, integration time, potential regulated genes, transcription
      factor binding sites (TFBS), and primer binding site (PBS) features. The
      integration time results showed that the HML-9 elements found in the human genome
      integrated into the primate lineage between 17.5 and 48.5 million years ago
      (mya). CONCLUSION: The results provide a clear characterization of HML-9 and a
      comprehensive background for subsequent functional studies.

AB  - Single crystals of three new compounds, Na0.36Sr0.82Ge4O9 (1, proposed
      composition), Na2SrGe6O14 (2), and K2SrGe8O18 (3), were obtained and
      characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Their structures contain
      three-dimensional (3D) anionic frameworks built from GeO4 and GeO6 polyhedra. The
      presence of octahedral Ge(4+) sites makes the new phases suitable for Mn(4+)
      substitution to obtain red-emitting phosphors with a potential application for
      light conversion. Photoluminescence properties of Mn(4+)-substituted Na2SrGe6O14 
      (2) and K2SrGe8O18 (3) samples were studied over a range of temperatures, and red
      light photoluminescence associated with the electronic transitions of tetravalent
      manganese was observed. The Na2SrGe6O14 (2) phase was also substituted with
      Pr(3+) on the mixed Na-Sr site similar to the previously studied
      Na2CaGe6O14:Pr(3+). The red emission peak of the Pr(3+) activator occurs at a
      shorter wavelength (610 nm) compared to that of Mn(4+) (662-663 nm).
      Additionally, second harmonic generation (SHG) data were collected for the
      noncentrosymmetric Na2SrGe6O14 (2) phase, indicating weak SHG activity. Diffuse
      reflectance spectroscopy and density of states calculations were performed to
      estimate the band gap values for pristine Na2SrGe6O14 (2) and K2SrGe8O18 (3)
      phases.

TI  - Combining K Nearest Neighbor With Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Predicting
      Circrna-Disease Associations.
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2022.3180903 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidences show that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role 
      in regulating gene expression, and involve in many complex human diseases.
      Identifying associations of circRNA with disease helps to understand the
      pathogenesis, treatment and diagnosis of complex diseases. Since inferring
      circRNA-disease associations by biological experiments is costly and
      time-consuming, there is an urgently need to develop a computational model to
      identify the association between them. In this paper, we proposed a novel method 
      named KNN-NMF, which combines <?TeX K ?>nearest neighbors with nonnegative matrix
      factorization to infer associations between circRNA and disease (KNN-NMF). Frist,
      we compute the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity of circRNA
      and disease, the semantic similarity of disease, respectively. Then, the
      circRNA-disease new interaction profiles are established using weight <?TeX K?>
      nearest neighbors to reduce the false negative association impact on prediction
      performance. Finally, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization is implemented to predict 
      associations of circRNA with disease. The experiment results indicate that the
      prediction performance of KNN-NMF outperforms the competing methods under
      five-fold cross-validation. Moreover, case studies of two common diseases further
      show that KNN-NMF can identify potential circRNA-disease associations
      effectively.

TI  - An Improved Parameter Estimator of the Homodyned K Distribution Based on the
      Maximum Likelihood Method for Ultrasound Tissue Characterization.
PG  - 142-160
LID - 10.1177/01617346221097867 [doi]
AB  - The homodyned K distribution (HK) can generally describe the ultrasound
      backscatter envelope statistics distribution with parameters that have specific
      physical meaning. However, creating robust and reliable HK parameter estimates
      remains a crucial concern. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) usually yields 
      a small variance and bias in parameter estimation. Thus, two recent studies have 
      attempted to use MLE for parameter estimation of HK distribution. However, some
      of the statements in these studies are not fully justified and they may hinder
      the application of parameter estimation of HK distribution based on MLE. In this 
      study, we propose a new parameter estimator for the HK distribution based on the 
      MLE (i.e., MLE1), which overcomes the disadvantages of conventional MLE of HK
      distribution. The MLE1 was compared with other estimators, such as XU estimator
      (an estimation method based on the first moment of the intensity and tow
      log-moments) and ANN estimator (an estimation method based on artificial neural
      networks). We showed that the estimations of parameters alpha and k are the best 
      overall (in terms of the relative bias, normalized standard deviation, and
      relative root mean squared errors) using the proposed MLE1 compared with the
      others based on the simulated data when the sample size was N = 1000. Moreover,
      we assessed the usefulness of the proposed MLE1 when the number of scatterers per
      resolution cell was high (i.e., alpha up to 80) and when the sample size was
      small (i.e., N = 100), and we found a satisfactory result. Tests on simulated
      ultrasound images based on Field II were performed and the results confirmed that
      the proposed MLE1 is feasible and reliable for the parameter estimation from the 
      ultrasonic envelope signal. Therefore, the proposed MLE1 can accurately estimate 
      the HK parameters with lower uncertainty, which presents a potential practical
      value for further ultrasonic applications.

      (N = 153), participated at Time 1 only, and the second subsample (N = 184)
      participated at both Time 1 and Time 2. At each time point, reliability,

LID - jeb244097 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.244097 [doi]
AB  - Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a type of phenotypic plasticity that delays the
      occurrence of chill coma in insects. Chill coma is mediated by a spreading
      depolarization of neurons and glia in the CNS, triggered by a failure of ion
      homeostasis. We used biochemical and electrophysiological approaches in the
      locust, Locusta migratoria, to test the hypothesis that the protection afforded
      by RCH is mediated by activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in neural tissue. RCH
      did not affect NKA activity measured in a biochemical assay of homogenized
      thoracic ganglia. However, RCH hyperpolarized the axon of a visual interneuron
      (DCMD) and increased the amplitude of an activity-dependent hyperpolarization
      (ADH) shown previously to be blocked by ouabain. RCH also improved performance of
      the visual circuitry presynaptic to DCMD to minimize habituation and increase
      excitability. We conclude that RCH enhances in situ NKA activity in the nervous
      system but also affects other neuronal properties that promote visual processing 
      in locusts.

AB  - Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase is an essential transmembrane enzyme found in all mammalian
      cells with critical functions for cell ion homeostasis. The inhibition of this
      enzyme by several cardiotonic steroids (CTS) has been associated with the
      cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines of phytochemicals such as ouabain and
      digitoxin. This study evaluated the inhibitory capacity of cardenolides
      calotropin and corotoxigenin 3-O-glucopyranoside (C3OG) from Asclepias subulata
      over the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in vitro and silico. The inhibitory assays
      showed that calotropin and C3OG decreased the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity with
      IC50 values of 0.27 and 0.87 muM, respectively. Furthermore, the molecules
      presented an uncompetitive inhibition on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, with Ki
      values of 0.2 muM to calotropin and 0.5 muM to C3OG. Furthermore, the molecular
      modeling indicated that calotropin and C3OG might interact with the Thr(797) and 
      Gln(111) residues, considered essential to the interaction with the
      Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Besides, these cardenolides can interact with amino acid
      residues such as Phe(783), Leu(125), and Ala(323), to establish hydrophobic
      interactions on the binding site. Considering the results, these provide novel
      evidence about the mechanism of action of cardenolides from A. subulata,
      proposing that C3OG is a novel cardenolide that deserves further consideration
      for in vitro cellular antiproliferative assays and in vivo studies as an
      anticancer molecule.

TI  - Salinity-dependent modulation by protein kinases and the FXYD2 peptide of gill
      (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity in the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum
      (Decapoda, Palaemonidae).

AB  - The geographical distribution of aquatic crustaceans is determined by ambient
      factors like salinity that modulate their biochemistry, physiology, behavior,
      reproduction, development and growth. We investigated the effects of exogenous
      pig FXYD2 peptide and endogenous protein kinases A and C on gill (Na(+),
      K(+))-ATPase activity, and characterized enzyme kinetic properties in a
      freshwater population of Macrobrachium amazonicum in fresh water (<0.5 per
      thousand salinity) or acclimated to 21 per thousandS. Stimulation by FXYD2
      peptide and inhibition by endogenous kinase phosphorylation are
      salinity-dependent. While without effect in shrimps in fresh water, the FXYD2
      peptide stimulated activity in salinity-acclimated shrimps by approximately 50 %.
      PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibited gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity by 85 %
      in acclimated shrimps while PKC phosphorylation markedly inhibited enzyme
      activity in freshwater- and salinity-acclimated shrimps. The (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase
      in salinity-acclimated shrimp gills hydrolyzed ATP at a Vmax of 54.9 +/- 1.8 nmol
      min(-1) mg(-1) protein, corresponding to approximately 60 % that of freshwater
      shrimps. Mg(2+) affinity increased with salinity acclimation while K(+) affinity 
      decreased. (Ca(2+), Mg(2+))-ATPase activity increased while V(H(+))- and Na(+)-
      or K(+)-stimulated activities decreased on salinity acclimation. The 120-kDa
      immunoreactive band expressed in salinity-acclimated shrimps suggests nonspecific
      alpha-subunit phosphorylation by PKA and/or PKC. These alterations in (Na(+),
      K(+))-ATPase kinetics in salinity-acclimated M. amazonicum may result from
      regulatory mechanisms mediated by phosphorylation via protein kinases A and C and
      the FXYD2 peptide rather than through the expression of a different alpha-subunit
      isoform. This is the first demonstration of gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase regulation 
      by protein kinases in freshwater shrimps during salinity challenge.

TI  - Associations between dietary intake of vitamin K and changes in symptomatic and
      structural changes in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
LID - 10.1002/acr.24964 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of dietary vitamin K intake with changes
      in knee symptoms and structures in patients with knee OA. METHOD: Participants
      with symptomatic knee OA were enrolled (n=259) and followed up for 2 years
      (n=212). Baseline dietary vitamin K intake was calculated from a validated food
      frequency questionnaire. Knee symptoms were assessed by using the Western Ontario
      and McMaster University Index of osteoarthritis (WOMAC) scores. Knee cartilage
      defects, bone marrow lesions and effusion-synovitis volume were measured from MRI
      scans. Univariable and multivariable linear regressions were used for analyses.
      RESULTS: Higher vitamin K intake quartile was significantly associated with
      greater decrease in total WOMAC score and dysfunction score over 24 months. The
      subgroup analyses showed in patients with severe baseline VAS pain, higher
      vitamin K intake quartile was associated with more improvement in all WOMAC
      scores. There were no overall significant associations between vitamin K intake
      and changes in MRI features. In sub-group analysis, vitamin K intake was
      negatively associated with changes in tibiofemoral, patellar and total cartilage 
      defects in participants with severe baseline radiographic grade, and was
      negatively associated with change in total and patellar cartilage defects in
      participants with severe baseline VAS pain and in female patients. CONCLUSION:
      The association of higher vitamin K intake with decreased knee symptoms over 24
      months in patients with knee OA suggests that clinical trials examining the
      effect of vitamin K supplementation for knee OA symptoms are warranted. Whether
      there is an effect on knee structure is unclear. This article is protected by

      Clustering Algorithm.
PG  - 6797185
LID - 10.1155/2022/6797185 [doi]
AB  - Corporate financial risks not only endanger the financial stability of digital
      industry but also cause huge losses to the macro-economy and social wealth. In
      order to detect and warn digital industry financial risks in time, this paper
      proposes an early warning system of digital industry financial risks based on
      improved K-means clustering algorithm. Aiming to speed up the K-means calculation
      and find the optimal clustering subspace, a specific transformation matrix is
      used to project the data. The feature space is divided into clustering space and 
      noise space. The former contains all spatial structure information; the latter
      does not contain any information. Each iteration of K-means is carried out in the
      clustering space, and the effect of dimensionality screening is achieved in the
      iteration process. At the same time, the retained dimensions are fed back to the 
      next iteration. The dimensional information of the cluster space is discovered
      automatically, so no additional parameters are introduced. Experimental results
      show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than other algorithms 
      in financial risk detection.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Staphylococcal Phage K Following Parenteral and
      Intra-articular Administration in Rabbits.

LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.840165 [doi]
AB  - The therapeutic value of phage as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment
      of bacterial infections is being considered in the wake of mounting antibiotic
      resistance. In this study, the pharmacokinetic properties of Staphylococcus
      aureus phage K following intravenous and intra-articular administration were
      investigated in a rabbit model. Using a traditional plaque assay and a novel
      quantitative PCR assay to measure phage levels in specimens over time, it was
      found that intra-articularly administered phage enters the systemic circulation; 
      that phage may be detected in synovial fluid up to 24 h following the
      intra-articular, but not intravenous, administration; and that qPCR-based
      enumeration is generally more sensitive than plaque enumeration, with fair to
      moderate correlation between the two methods. Findings presented should inform
      the design of phage therapy experiments and therapeutic drug monitoring in
      preclinical and human phage studies.

      circuit approach.

AB  - The development of noisy intermediate- scale quantum computers is expected to
      signify the potential advantages of quantum computing over classical computing.
      This paper focuses on quantum paradigm usage to speed up unsupervised machine
      learning algorithms particularly the K-means clustering method. The main approach
      is to build a quantum circuit that performs the distance calculation required for
      the clustering process. This proposed technique is a collaboration of data mining
      techniques with quantum computation. Initially, extracted heart disease dataset
      is preprocessed and classical K-means clustering performance is evaluated. Later,
      the quantum concept is applied to the classical approach of the clustering
      algorithm. The comparative analysis is performed between quantum and classical
      processing to check performance metrics.

TI  - Real-time MRI motion estimation through an unsupervised k-space-driven deformable
      registration network (KS-RegNet).
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac762c [doi]
AB  - Purpose. Real-time three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is
      challenging because of slow MR signal acquisition, leading to highly
      under-sampled k-space data. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based,
      k-space-driven deformable registration network (KS-RegNet) for real-time 3D MR
      imaging. By incorporating prior information, KS-RegNet performs a deformable
      image registration between a fully-sampled prior image and on-board images
      acquired from highly-under-sampled k-space data, to generate high-quality
      on-board images for real-time motion tracking.Methods. KS-RegNet is an
      end-to-end, unsupervised network consisting of an input data generation block, a 
      subsequent U-Net core block, and following operations to compute data fidelity
      and regularization losses. The input data involved a fully-sampled,
      complex-valued prior image, and the k-space data of an on-board, real-time MR
      image (MRI). From the k-space data, under-sampled real-time MRI was reconstructed
      by the data generation block to input into the U-Net core. In addition, to train 
      the U-Net core to learn the under-sampling artifacts, the k-space data of the
      prior image was intentionally under-sampled using the same readout trajectory as 
      the real-time MRI, and reconstructed to serve an additional input. The U-Net core
      predicted a deformation vector field that deforms the prior MRI to on-board
      real-time MRI. To avoid adverse effects of quantifying image similarity on the
      artifacts-ridden images, the data fidelity loss of deformation was evaluated
      directly in k-space.Results. Compared with Elastix and other deep learning
      network architectures, KS-RegNet demonstrated better and more stable performance.
      The average (+/-s.d.) DICE coefficients of KS-RegNet on a cardiac dataset for the
      5- , 9- , and 13-spoke k-space acquisitions were 0.884 +/- 0.025, 0.889 +/-
      0.024, and 0.894 +/- 0.022, respectively; and the corresponding average (+/-s.d.)
      center-of-mass errors (COMEs) were 1.21 +/- 1.09, 1.29 +/- 1.22, and 1.01 +/-
      0.86 mm, respectively. KS-RegNet also provided the best performance on an
      abdominal dataset.Conclusion. KS-RegNet allows real-time MRI generation with
      sub-second latency. It enables potential real-time MR-guided soft tissue
      tracking, tumor localization, and radiotherapy plan adaptation.

      randomization study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive disease for which there is no
      disease modifying therapy. Vitamin K levels and vitamin K antagonism have been
      associated with risk and progression of OA which may have direct implications for
      clinical management, but these observational findings are susceptible to
      confounding. We aimed to estimate the causal association between vitamin K and OA
      risk using Mendelian randomisation (MR). METHODS: We used data from the largest
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OA to date (up to 826,690 individuals) to
      estimate the effect of genetically predicted vitamin K level (instrumented using 
      four variants derived from a GWAS of 2,138 individuals) on risk of all OA types, 
      knee, hip, spine, hand OA, and total joint replacement. We employed the
      inverse-variance weighted method for the primary analysis and, in a series of
      sensitivity analyses, adjusted for sub-genome wide significant instruments and
      tested for potential bias from pleiotropy. RESULTS: We showed that genetically
      predicted vitamin K levels were not causally associated with risk of OA overall
      (OR 0.98 per unit increase in log-transformed vitamin K1; 95%CI 0.96-1.01), knee 
      (OR 0.98; 0.92-1.03), hip (OR 0.97; 0.88-1.07), spine (OR 0.97; 0.90-1.04), hand 
      OA (OR 0.97; 0.91-1.04) or joint replacement (OR 0.96; 0.89-1.04). Results were
      similar across all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: We found little evidence of 
      a causal association between genetically predicted vitamin K and OA risk. Larger 
      genetic and interventional studies of vitamin K are required to confirm our
      findings.

TI  - Gradient-echo-train-based sub-millisecond periodic event encoded dynamic imaging 
      with random (k, t)-space undersampling: k-t get-SPEEDI.
PG  - 1690-1701
LID - 10.1002/mrm.29313 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The gradient-echo-train-based Sub-millisecond Periodic Event Encoded
      Dynamic Imaging (get-SPEEDI) technique provides ultrahigh temporal resolutions ( 
      approximately 0.6 ms) for detecting rapid physiological activities, but its
      practical adoption can be hampered by long scan times. This study aimed at
      developing a more efficient variant of get-SPEEDI for reducing the scan time
      without degrading temporal resolution or image quality. METHODS: The proposed
      pulse sequence, named k-t get-SPEEDI, accelerated get-SPEEDI acquisition by
      undersampling the k-space phase-encoding lines semi-randomly. At each time frame,
      k-space was fully sampled in the central region whereas randomly undersampled in 
      the outer regions. A time-series of images was reconstructed using an algorithm
      based on the joint partial separability and sparsity constraints. To demonstrate 
      the performance of k-t get-SPEEDI, images of human aortic valve opening and
      closing were acquired with 0.6-ms temporal resolution and compared with those
      from conventional get-SPEEDI. RESULTS: k-t get-SPEEDI achieved a 2-fold scan time
      reduction over the conventional get-SPEEDI (from approximately 6 to approximately
      3 min), while achieving comparable SNRs and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRs) for
      visualizing the dynamic process of aortic valve: SNR/CNR approximately $$ \approx
      $$ 70/38 vs. 73/39 in the k-t and conventional get-SPEEDI scans, respectively.
      The time courses of aortic valve area also matched well between these two
      sequences with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: The k-t get-SPEEDI
      pulse sequence was able to half the scan time without compromising the image
      quality and ultrahigh temporal resolution. Additional scan time reduction may
      also be possible, facilitating in vivo adoptions of SPEEDI techniques.

AB  - Using a data sample of s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS
      experiment at the LHC in 2017 and 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 103 fb - 
      1 , the B s 0 --> psi ( 2S ) K S 0 and B 0 --> psi ( 2S ) K S 0 pi + pi - decays 
      are observed with significances exceeding 5 standard deviations. The resulting
      branching fraction ratios, measured for the first time, correspond to B ( B s 0
      --> psi ( 2S ) K S 0 ) / B ( B 0 --> psi ( 2S ) K S 0 ) = ( 3.33 +/- 0.69 ( stat 
      ) +/- 0.11 ( syst ) +/- 0.34 ( f s / f d ) ) x 10 - 2 and B ( B 0 --> psi ( 2S ) 
      K S 0 pi + pi - ) / B ( B 0 --> psi ( 2S ) K S 0 ) = 0.480 +/- 0.013 ( stat ) +/-
      0.032 ( syst ) , where the last uncertainty in the first ratio is related to the 
      uncertainty in the ratio of production cross sections of B s 0 and B 0 mesons, f 
      s / f d .

AB  - The limited availability of cathode materials with high specific capacity and
      significant cycling stability for aqueous K-ion batteries (AKIBs) hinder their
      further development owing to the large radius of K(+) (1.38 A). Prussian blue and
      its analogs with a three-dimensional frame structure possessing special energy
      storage mechanism are promising candidates as cathode materials for AKIBs. In
      this study, K0.2 Ni0.68 Co0.77 Fe(CN)6 1.8H2 O (KNCHCF) was prepared as a cathode
      material for AKIBs. Both the electrochemical activity of Co ions and the
      near-pseudocapacitance intercalation of KNCHCF enhance K(+) storage. Therefore,
      KNCHCF exhibits a superior capacity maintenance rate of 86 % after 1000 cycles at
      a high current density of 3.0 A g(-1) . The storage mechanism of K(+) in AKIBs
      was revealed through ex situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ Fourier transform
      infrared spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.
      Moreover, the assembled K-Zn hybrid battery showed good cycling stability with
      93.1 % capacity maintenance at 0.1 A g(-1) after 50 cycles and a high energy
      density of 96.81 W h kg(-1) . Hence, KNCHCF may be a potential material for the
      development of AKIBs.

AB  - In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), drug dosage is an important part of the
      prescription. Different doses of the same drug can have varying curative effects.
      Doctors must determine the drug combination and dosage in clinical practice based
      on the patient's symptoms and treatment efficacy. Existing studies on the
      prescription pattern of TCM on the treatment of osteoporosis only analyze the
      frequency that a certain drug combination is used, without considering the
      treatment efficacy or drug dosage. As a result, we searched for and recorded
      existing literature on randomized controlled trials of TCM treatment of
      osteoporosis, calculated weights based on the treatment efficacy of the
      prescriptions used in the randomized controlled trials, and created the TCM
      weighted transaction database. Then, a new multilevel Top-K weighted association 
      rule algorithm is proposed to obtain effective prescription patterns that include
      drug dosages, which can assist doctors in clinical practice in choosing a
      combination of drugs to form a prescription with good curative effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bridging of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with heparin is usually not
      promoted during interventional or surgical procedures related to increased risk
      of bleeding and thrombotic events but this strategy has not been evaluated during
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). PURPOSE: The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the rate of major bleeding and vascular complications after TAVI 
      performed in patients with uninterrupted VKA. METHODS: From January 2016 to
      October 2017, consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with uninterrupted VKA
      (International Normalized Ratio [INR] between 1.5 and 3.5) were prospectively
      included in a monocentric registry. TAVI was performed according to current
      guidelines and a 50 U/kg bolus of heparin was injected at the beginning of the
      procedure for all patients. Vascular and bleeding complications were assessed
      using the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC3) and the Bleeding Academic 
      Research Consortium (BARC) definitions at a 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: A total of
      88 patients were included with a median age of 84 years (81.8-87.0), 42% being
      female. The median society of thoracic surgeons score was 5.1 (4.1-7.5), the
      median CHADS2-VASc was 5.5 (5-6) and 60.2% had a chronic kidney failure. Median
      INR at the time of implantation was 2.1 (1.8-2.6). The main VKA indication was
      atrial fibrillation. Transfemoral access was used in 88.6% of the patients. Major
      bleeding (BARC >/= 3b) occurred in five patients (5.7%) and major vascular
      complications occurred in seven patients (8.0%). At 1 month follow-up, major
      bleeding (BARC >/= 3) or vascular complications occurred in 10 patients (11.4%). 
      In patients with major bleeding peripheral arterial disease (RR = 10.95; 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.63-73.75; p = 0.014) and carotid access (RR = 8.56;
      95% CI 1.19-1.51; p = 0.033) were more common. INR > 2.5 was significantly
      associated with vascular complications (RR = 7.14; 95% CI 1.29-39.63; p = 0.025).
      At 30 days, mortality and stroke rates were 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: TAVI with uninterrupted VKA treatment seems feasible and safe with a 
      low risk of major bleeding and vascular complications in this first single-center
      experience. Particular caution is advocated in high body mass index patients and 
      to keep INR < 2.5.

TI  - Removal of bacterial indicators in on-site two-stage multi-soil-layering plant
      under arid climate (Morocco): prediction of total coliform content using
      K-nearest neighbor algorithm.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate and monitor the efficacy of a full-scale two-stage
      multi-soil-layering (TS-MSL) plant in removing fecal contamination from domestic 
      wastewater. The TS-MSL plant under investigation consisted of two units in
      series, one with a vertical flow regime (VF-MSL) and the other with a horizontal 
      flow regime (HF-MSL). Furthermore, this study attempts to see whether linear
      model (LM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) model can be used to predict total
      coliform (TC) removal in the TS-MSL system. For 24 months, the TS-MSL system was 
      monitored, with bimonthly measurements recorded at the inlet and outlet of each
      compartment. Obtained results show removal of 85% of COD, 67% of TP, 27% of TN,
      and 3 log units of coliforms with good system stability. Thus, the effluent meets
      the Moroccan water quality code for reuse in the irrigation of green spaces. In
      addition, as compared to LM, the KNN model (R(2) = 0.988) may be considered as an
      effective method for predicting TC removal in the TS-MSL system. Finally,
      sensitivity analysis has shown that TC and dissolved oxygen level in the influent
      were the most influential parameters for predicting TC removal in the TS-MSL
      system.

TI  - Regulation of Rostral Nucleus of the Solitary Tract Responses to Afferent Input
      by A-type K+ Current.
PG  - 115-125

AB  - Responses in the rostral (gustatory) nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) are
      modified by synaptic interactions within the nucleus and the constitutive
      membrane properties of the neurons themselves. The potassium current IA is one
      potential source of modulation. In the caudal NST, projection neurons with IA
      show lower fidelity to afferent stimulation compared to cells without. We
      explored the role of an A-type K+ current (IA) in modulating the response to
      afferent stimulation and GABA-mediated inhibition in the rNST using whole cell
      patch clamp recording in transgenic mice that expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2
      H134R) in GABAergic neurons. The presence of IA was determined in current clamp
      and the response to electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the solitary
      tract was assessed before and after treatment with the specific Kv4 channel
      blocker AmmTX3. Blocking IA significantly increased the response to afferent
      stimulation by 53%. Using dynamic clamp to create a synthetic IA conductance, we 
      demonstrated a significant 14% decrease in responsiveness to afferent stimulation
      in cells lacking IA. Because IA reduced excitability and is
      hyperpolarization-sensitive, we examined whether IA contributed to the inhibition
      resulting from optogenetic release of GABA. Although blocking IA decreased the
      percent suppression induced by GABA, this effect was attributable to the
      increased responsiveness resulting from AmmTX3, not to a change in the absolute
      magnitude of suppression. We conclude that rNST responses to afferent input are
      regulated independently by IA and GABA.

TI  - Methadone Blockade of Cardiac Inward Rectifier K(+) Current Augments Membrane
      Instability and Amplifies U Waves on Surface ECGs: A Translational Study.
PG  - e023482
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.023482 [doi]
AB  - Background Methadone is associated with a disproportionate risk of sudden death
      and ventricular tachyarrhythmia despite only modest inhibition of delayed
      rectifier K(+) current (IKr), the principal mechanism of drug-associated
      arrhythmia. Congenital defects of inward rectifier K(+) current (IK1) have been
      linked to increased U-wave amplitude on ECG and fatal arrhythmia. We hypothesized
      that methadone may also be a potent inhibitor of IK1, contributing to delayed
      repolarization and manifesting on surface ECGs as augmented U-wave integrals.
      Methods and Results Using a whole-cell voltage clamp, methadone inhibited both
      recombinant and native IK1 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50) of 
      1.5 mumol/L, similar to that observed for IKr block (half-maximal inhibitory
      concentration of 2.9 mumol/L). Methadone modestly increased the action potential 
      duration at 90% repolarization and slowed terminal repolarization at low
      concentrations. At higher concentrations, action potential duration at 90%
      repolarization lengthening was abolished, but its effect on terminal
      repolarization rose steadily and correlated with increased fluctuations of
      diastolic membrane potential. In parallel, patient ECGs were analyzed before and 
      after methadone initiation, with 68% of patients having a markedly increased
      U-wave integral compared with premethadone (lead V3; mean +38%+/-15%, P=0.016),
      along with increased QT and TPeak to TEnd intervals, likely reflective of IKr
      block. Conclusions Methadone is a potent IK1 inhibitor that causes augmentation
      of U waves on surface ECG. We propose that increased membrane instability
      resulting from IK1 block may better explain methadone's arrhythmia risk beyond
      IKr inhibition alone. Drug-induced augmentation of U waves may represent evidence
      of blockade of multiple repolarizing ion channels, and evaluation of the effect
      of that agent on IK1 may be warranted.

AB  - SignificanceThe present work might be significant for exploring advanced K-ion
      batteries with superb rate capability and cycle stability toward practical
      applications. The as-assembled K-ion half cell exhibits an excellent rate
      capability of 428 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a high reversible specific
      capacity of 330 mA h g(-1) with 120% specific capacity retention after 2,000
      cycles at 2,000 mA g(-1), which is the best among those based on carbon
      materials. The as-constructed full cell delivers 98% specific capacity retention 
      over 750 cycles at 500 mA g(-1), superior to most of those based on carbon
      materials that have been reported thus far.

TI  - Role of a conserved ion-binding site tyrosine in ion selectivity of the Na+/K+
      pump.
LID - e202113039 [pii]
LID - 10.1085/jgp.202113039 [doi]
AB  - The essential transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients in animal cells are established 
      by the Na+/K+ pump, a P-type ATPase that exports three Na+ and imports two K+ per
      ATP hydrolyzed. The mechanism by which the Na+/K+ pump distinguishes between Na+ 
      and K+ at the two membrane sides is poorly understood. Crystal structures
      identify two sites (sites I and II) that bind Na+ or K+ and a third (site III)
      specific for Na+. The side chain of a conserved tyrosine at site III of the
      catalytic alpha-subunit (Xenopus-alpha1 Y780) has been proposed to contribute to 
      Na+ binding by cation-pi interaction. We substituted Y780 with natural and
      unnatural amino acids, expressed the mutants in Xenopus oocytes and COS-1 cells, 
      and used electrophysiology and biochemistry to evaluate their function.
      Substitutions disrupting H-bonds impaired Na+ interaction, while Y780Q
      strengthened it, likely by H-bond formation. Utilizing the non-sense suppression 
      method previously used to incorporate unnatural derivatives in ion channels, we
      were able to analyze Na+/K+ pumps with fluorinated tyrosine or phenylalanine
      derivatives inserted at position 780 to diminish cation-pi interaction strength. 
      In line with the results of the analysis of mutants with natural amino acid
      substitutions, the results with the fluorinated derivatives indicate that Na+-pi 
      interaction with the phenol ring at position 780 contributes minimally, if at
      all, to the binding of Na+. All Y780 substitutions decreased K+ apparent
      affinity, highlighting that a state-dependent H-bond network is essential for the
      selectivity switch at sites I and II when the pump changes conformational state.

TI  - Understanding the Deactivating/Activating Mechanisms in Three Optical
      Chemosensors Based on Crown Ether with Na(+) /K(+) Selectivity Using Quantum
      Chemical Tools.
PG  - e202200188
LID - 10.1002/cphc.202200188 [doi]
AB  - The optical properties and transduction mechanisms in three reported optical
      chemosensors based on crown ether with selectivity turn-on luminescence toward
      Na(+) over K(+) , were investigated using Density Functional
      Theory/Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (DFT/TD-DFT). The analysis of the
      structural stability of the conformers enables us to understand the optical
      properties of the sensors and their selectivity toward Na(+) . The UV-Vis
      absorption and the radiative channels of the adiabatic S1 excited state were
      assessed. In these reported sensors, the Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET)
      from the nitrogen and the oxygen (O-atoms of the substituted N-phenylaza group)
      lone pairs to fluorophore groups lead to a nonradiative deactivation process in
      the fluorophore to p-conjugated anilino-1,2,3-triazol ionophore. This
      Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) deactivation produced the luminescence
      quenching in the free sensors and K(+) /C1 complexes. The Na(+) /sensor
      interaction produced a Chelation Enhanced Fluorescence (CHEF) due to the
      inhibition of the PET and ICT, which was confirmed via the calculated oscillator 
      strength of the emission process. The K(+) /sensor interaction displayed the
      possibility of PET in C3; however, this fact was inconclusive to affirm the
      quenching of luminescence, the CHEF in C2 and C3 and the selectivity toward Na(+)
      over K(+) in these systems. For this reason, simulation of the absorption and
      emissions spectra (calculated oscillator strength), calculation of the kinetic
      parameters (in charge transfers and radiative deactivations process), analysis of
      the metal-ligand interaction character, and the analysis of the structural
      stability of the conformers were determinant factors to understand the
      selectivity and the optical properties of these chemosensors. The results suggest
      that these theoretical tools can also be used to predict the optical properties
      and Na(+) /K(+) selectivity of optical chemosensors.

TI  - Impact of minor bleeds on confidence in anticoagulation therapy, adherence to
      treatment and quality of life in patients using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2022.2085963 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a previous study on the reasons for discontinuation of novel oral
      anticoagulation therapy (NOAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation, we showed
      that minor bleeding was the second most important reason for NOAC
      discontinuation. This finding suggest that the impact of minor bleeds on the
      patient's perspective on NOACs cannot be ignored, especially those minor bleeds
      for which the patient searched medical care. We therefore performed a study in
      which we explored the impact of minor bleed (clinically relevant non-major
      bleeds) on patient confidence in therapy, adherence to treatment and quality of
      life in AF patients using NOAC's. METHODS: Details on NOAC therapy, level of
      confidence, adherence and quality of life were assessed using a semi-structured
      telephone interview. Questions related to annoyance, concern and trust were
      scored on a scale of 1-10, with score 10 representing the highest level of impact
      or trust. For the adherence to treatment before and after a minor bleed the
      Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS-5) questionnaire was used. The total
      MARS-5 score ranges from 5 to 25; score 5 is indicative of poor adherence and 25 
      suggest perfect adherence. Furthermore, the impact (restrictions) of a bleed on
      physical activities and daily life was assessed using a VAS score ranging from 1 
      to 10; score 10 representing the highest level of restriction. RESULTS: A total
      of 142 patients were included. During NOAC treatment, minor bleeds were reported 
      by 87 patients (61%) of whom 16 (11%) suffered from a CRNMB. All patients that
      suffered from a CRNMB contacted their treating physician and 13 received
      treatment. The most frequently reported CRNMBs were epistaxis (n = 6), a bleed
      after injury (n = 3), rectal bleed (n = 2) and an eye bleed (n = 2). With regard 
      to the impact of a CRNMB, the median level of annoyance was 8 (min-max 2-10)) and
      the level of concern 4 (min-max 1-10). The MARS-5 score for adherence to
      treatment was only marginally influenced. Also the level of trust remained high
      after the CRNMB. Out of 12 patients, only 2 patients reported a reduction of 1
      and 8 points, respectively. Ten patients scored no change and one patient scored 
      a 1 point increase in the level of trust. The mean reduction in trust was 0.7
      (95%CI -0.8 to 2.2). With regard to the reported restrictions on physical
      activities, 8 out of 12 patients reported no (score 1) or only marginal impact
      (score 2), 2 patients reported a moderate impact (score 5 and 6) and 2 patients
      reported a high impact score 7 (mean score 2.9 (95%CI 1.3-4.5). For the daily
      life impact question, 5 out of 9 patients reported no or only marginal impact, 3 
      patients reported a moderate impact (scores 4 and 5) and 1 patient reported
      maximal impact (score 10) (mean score 3.2 (95%CI 0.9-5.5)). CONCLUSION: In our
      study the level of trust, annoyance and concern were not significantly impacted
      by the CRNMB, nor the adherence to treatment and impact on daily life and
      physical activities. However, on an individual basis, there were patients that
      reported a high impact. We hope that future data on impact of this type of minor 
      bleeds will help us identify and guide suboptimaly adherent NOAC patients in
      shared decision manner.

TI  - Outcomes of cardiac surgery with left atrial appendage occlusion versus no
      Occlusion, direct oral Anticoagulants, and vitamin K Antagonists: A systematic
      review with Meta-analysis.
PG  - 100998
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.100998 [doi]
AB  - Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is being used increasingly in the
      setting of atrial fibrillation but has been associated with procedural
      complications. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the outcomes of 
      surgical LAAO with those of no LAAO and the use of direct oral anticoagulants
      (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) using the PRISMA guidelines. A
      literature search was undertaken for relevant studies published between January
      1, 2003, and August 15, 2021. Primary clinical outcomes were all-cause mortality,
      embolic events, and stroke. Secondary clinical outcomes included major adverse
      cardiac events (MACE), postoperative atrial fibrillation, postoperative
      complications, reoperation for bleeding, and major bleeding. There was a
      statistically significant 34% reduction in incidence of embolic events (odds
      ratio [OR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.77, p < 0.001) and a
      significant 42% reduction in risk of MACE (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.88, p = 0.01)
      in patients who underwent LAAO.Surgical LAAO has the potential to reduce embolic 
      events and MACE in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for atrial fibrillation.
      However, complete replacement of DOACs and warfarin therapy with surgical LAAO is
      unlikely despite its non-inferiority in terms of minimizing all-cause mortality, 
      embolic events, MACE, major bleeding, and stroke in patients on oral
      anticoagulation therapies.

AB  - The concentration of potassium ion is an important indicator for human health,
      and its abnormality is often accompanied by various diseases. However, most tools
      currently used to study potassium ion transport are low throughput. Herein, we
      reported a new K(+) fluorescent nanoprobe CP1-KS with high selectivity and
      sensitivity to K(+) (fluorescence enhanced factor was up to 9.91 at 20 mM K(+)). 
      The polymeric fluorescent probe CP1-KS was composed of the small-molecular K(+)
      indicator KS and amphiphilic copolymer CP1. This sensor can be easily and
      uniformly dispersed in cell culture medium and is suitable for high throughput
      analysis. To assess the utility of the probe CP1-KS in biological field, this
      probe was employed as an extracellular fluorescent probe to monitor the efflux of
      K(+) from cells (E coli, B. Subtilis 168, Hela and MCF-7 cells) under various
      stimulation including lysozyme, nigericin, digitonin, and ATP. Results
      demonstrated that CP1-KS is an effective analysis tool for extracellular K(+)
      concentration. We believe that the nanoprobe has great potential in antibacterial
      drug screening, K(+) ionophore function, K(+) channel activity, cell membrane
      permeability analysis or other K(+) related field in the future.

TI  - The Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Immune Atlas: An open resource for immunological
      research and educational purposes.
PG  - e13195
LID - 10.1111/sji.13195 [doi]
AB  - The Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Immune Atlas project was conceptualized in March
      2020 as a part of the academic research response to the developing SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic. The aim was to rapidly provide a curated dataset covering the acute
      immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, as it occurred during the
      first wave. The Immune Atlas was built as an open resource for broad research and
      educational purposes. It contains a presentation of the response evoked by
      different immune and inflammatory cells in defined naive patient-groups as they
      presented with moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. The present Resource Article
      describes how the Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Immune Atlas allow scientists,
      students, and other interested parties to freely explore the nature of the immune
      response towards human SARS-CoV-2 infection in an online setting.

AB  - Identification of proteins is one of the most computationally intensive steps in 
      genomics studies. It usually relies on aligners that do not accommodate rich
      information on proteins and require additional pipelining steps for protein
      identification. We introduce kAAmer, a protein database engine based on
      amino-acid k-mers that provides efficient identification of proteins while
      supporting the incorporation of flexible annotations on these proteins. Moreover,
      the database is built to be used as a microservice, to be hosted and queried
      remotely.

TI  - DFT investigations of KTiOPO4Mx (M = K, Na, and Li) anodes for alkali-ion
      battery.
PG  - 204702
LID - 10.1063/5.0090071 [doi]
AB  - The properties of KTiOPO4Mx (M = K, Na, and Li; x = 0.000-1.000) as an anode for 
      potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and lithium-ion
      batteries (LIBs) are investigated by density functional theory calculations. Our 
      work reveals that the electrochemical performance of KTiOPO4 as an anode for PIBs
      is superior to that for SIBs and LIBs, in terms of average voltage and ion
      diffusion kinetics. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that
      the KTiOPO4Mx anode exhibits high structural stability, and alkali ion
      intercalation contributes to accelerating ion diffusion during the charging
      process. Particularly, the low activation energy of 0.406 eV of K migration on
      surface KTP(210), obtained by the climbing-image nudged elastic band method,
      suggests a high-rate capability. The systematical comparison of the performance
      of KTiOPO4 as an anode for PIBs, SIBs, and LIBs on the theoretical perspective
      clarifies that a large channel is not always promising for small radius ion
      intercalation and diffusion.

TI  - The Simons Observatory: A large-diameter truss for a refracting telescope cooled 
      to 1 K.
PG  - 055106
LID - 10.1063/5.0093857 [doi]
AB  - We present the design and measured performance of a new carbon fiber strut design
      that is used in a cryogenically cooled truss for the Simons Observatory small
      aperture telescope. The truss consists of two aluminum 6061 rings separated by 24
      struts. Each strut consists of a central carbon fiber tube fitted with two
      aluminum end caps. We tested the performance of the strut and truss by (i)
      cryogenically cycling and destructively pull-testing strut samples, (ii)
      non-destructively pull-testing the final truss, and (iii) measuring the thermal
      conductivity of the carbon fiber tubes. We found that the strut strength is
      limited by the mounting fasteners and the strut end caps, not the epoxy adhesive 
      or the carbon fiber tube. This result is consistent with our numerical
      predictions. Our thermal measurements suggest that the conductive heat load
      through the struts (from 4 to 1 K) will be less than 1 mW. This strut design may 
      be a promising candidate for use in other cryogenic support structures.

AB  - The most predominant type of resistance (R) genes contain nucleotide-binding
      sites and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains, characterization of which is
      helpful for plant resistance improvement. However, the NBS genes of Ipomoea
      trifida (H.B.K.) remain insufficient to date. In this study, a genome-wide
      analysis of the NBS-encoding gene in I. trifida (H.B.K.) was carried out. A total
      of 442 NBS encoding genes were identified, amounting to 1.37% of the total genes 
      of I. trifida (H.B.K.). Based on the analysis of the domains, the identified
      ItfNBS genes were further classified into seven groups: CNL, NL, CN, N, TNL, TN, 
      and RNL. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the I. trifida NBS genes clustered
      into three independent clades: RNL, TNL, and CNL. Chromosome location analysis
      revealed that the distribution of ItfNBS genes in chromosomes was uneven, with a 
      number ranging from 3 to 45. Multiple stress-related regulatory elements were
      detected in the promoters of the NBS-encoding genes, and their expression
      profiles were obtained. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that IbNBS10, IbNBS20,
      IbNBS258, and IbNBS88 responded to stem nematode infection. These results provide
      critical proof for further characterization and analysis of NBS-encoding genes
      with important functions.

AB  - Aims: The cold and hot properties of Chinese medicines are an important concept
      to represent the function of drugs, and are also a unique classification method
      of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The method reflects an herb's therapeutic 
      properties and guides reasonable clinical prescription. However, the present key 
      problem is the lack of an objective and quantitative evaluation index for the
      cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs. Delayed luminescence (DL) is the
      long-term afterglow of biological systems after illumination with light, which
      can reflect differences in herbal materials prepared under different conditions. 
      We aim to use S. obliquus as an indicator organism to characterize the
      differences between the cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs. Methods:
      Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) was used as an indicator organism to
      characterize the differences between the cold and hot properties of Chinese
      herbs. The decoction solution of different properties of Chinese herbs was added 
      to S. obliquus culture medium; then, the delayed luminescence (DL) of S. obliquus
      after the addition of decoctions of different properties of Chinese herbs was
      measured to obtain information on the effect of different properties of Chinese
      herbs on S. obliquus. Many DL parameters were calculated, and ROC curve analysis 
      was applied with the aim of finding a suitable parameter that can characterize
      the differences in cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs. Results: Our results
      show that the K value is a sensitive parameter that can reflect the differences
      of cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs, thus providing new insights into the
      cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs. Conclusions: DL measurement of S.
      obliquus after addition of different properties of Chinese herbs could be a novel
      and promising method to study the cold and hot properties of Chinese herbs.

AB  - The politics of children's literature and the actors surrounding it have never
      been more visible than they are now, in the digital age. As one of the first
      children's series to gain widespread popularity concurrently with the spread of
      the internet, the Harry Potter septet arrived on the global stage at the perfect 
      moment to develop an avid, connected fandom. But the fandom has laid bare the
      many conflicting ideologies of the fans themselves and of the actors surrounding 
      the texts. This article examines the contentious issue of gender nonnormativity
      and its relation to the Harry Potter texts, the queer/trans reading practices and
      political resistance common to the fandom, and the ongoing disagreements over
      gender, made visible on social media, between Rowling and the fans of her series.
      The article discusses the Harry Potter novels' varied and conflicting ideologies;
      queer/trans readings of the Potter septet, including both invitations and
      resistances to queer/trans reading by Rowling herself; how gender is queered and 
      queried in and through fan fiction; and finally, the recent hostilities between
      Rowling and her fans. It concludes by discussing the worsening relationship
      between Rowling and her fans and highlighting how fans are using their collective
      power to undermine Rowling's gender politics through fan fiction. By doing so,
      the article traces the complex politics of the reception of books for young
      people in the digital age, demonstrating that authors' powerful voices continue
      to shape readers' responses to texts long after their publication but showing,
      too, that readers often resist authors' attempts to influence not only their
      textual interpretations but their politics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current surveillance strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are insufficient.
      This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of alpha-fetoprotein
      (AFP), protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), lens
      culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), and their combinations in
      HCC underlying NAFLD patients. METHODS: Serologic AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA-II
      levels in NAFLD patients with and without HCC were measured. By receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve (AUC),
      sensitivity, and specificity were obtained to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
      each biomarker and their combinations. RESULTS: This study was conducted on 139
      patients with NAFLD-HCC and 345 NAFLD controls. The elevation of these three
      biomarkers was observed in patients with NAFLD-HCC compared to those in NAFLD
      controls (all P < 0.001). When they were analyzed individually, PIVKA-II showed
      the best performance in diagnosing any-stage HCC with an AUC of 0.869, followed
      by AFP (0.763; vs. PIVKA-II, P < 0.001) and AFP-L3 (0.689; vs. PIVKA-II, P <
      0.001). When they were analyzed in combination, AFP + PIVKA-II yielded the
      highest AUC (0.906), followed by AFP + PIVKA-II + AFP-L3 (0.904; vs. AFP +
      PIVKA-II, P = 0.086), PIVKA-II + AFP-L3 (0.881; vs. AFP + PIVKA-II, P < 0.001),
      and AFP + AFP-L3 (0.759; vs. AFP + PIVKA-II, P < 0.001). Similar findings were
      obtained in the subgroup with early-stage NAFLD-HCC, as well as the non-cirrhotic
      subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: These data validated the better diagnostic ability of
      PIVKA-II than AFP or AFP-L3 alone for diagnosing any-stage HCC among patients
      with NAFLD, and the combination of AFP + PIVKA-II significantly improved the
      diagnostic accuracy of NAFLD-HCC.

AB  - Melatonin secretion from the pineal glands regulates circadian rhythms in
      mammals. Melatonin production is decreased by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+)
      concentration following the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in
      parasympathetic systems. We previously reported that pineal Ca(2+) oscillations
      were regulated by voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and large-conductance
      Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BKCa) channels, which inhibited melatonin production. In
      the present study, the contribution of small- and intermediate-conductance
      Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SKCa and IKCa) channels to the regulation of spontaneous
      Ca(2+) oscillations was examined in rat pinealocytes. The amplitude and frequency
      of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations were increased by a SKCa channel blocker (100 
      nM apamin), but not by an IKCa channel blocker (1 muM TRAM-34). On the other
      hand, they were decreased by a SKCa channel opener (100 muM DCEBIO), but not by
      an IKCa channel opener (1 muM DCEBIO). Expression analyses using quantitative
      real-time PCR, immunocytochemical staining, and Western blotting revealed that
      the SKCa2 channel subtype was abundantly expressed in rat pinealocytes. Moreover,
      the enhanced amplitude of Ca(2+) oscillations in the presence of apamin was
      further increased by a BKCa channel blocker (1 muM paxilline). These results
      suggest that the activity of SKCa2 channels regulates cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling 
      and melatonin production during parasympathetic activation in pineal glands.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
      receptor) receptors play a central role in neurotransmission and neuronal
      function. A positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for AMPA receptors,
      [(11)C]K-2, was recently developed by us to visualize AMPA receptors in the
      living human brain. [(11)C]K-2 is a derivative of
      4-[2-(phenylsulphonylamino)ethylthio]-2,6-difuluoro-phenoxyacetamide (PEPA), and 
      is labeled with the radioactive isotope (11)C, which has a short half-life. PET
      drugs are usually labeled with (18)F because of its long half-life. Therefore, we
      screened and identified potential (18)F-labeled PET drugs for AMPA receptors
      (AMPA-PET drugs), which could provide an image equivalent to that of [(11)C]K-2. 
      METHODS: Derivatives of K-2 labeled with (18)F were synthesized and administered 
      to rats and PET imaging was performed. The transferability of each compound to
      the brain and its correlation with the PET image of [(11)C]K-2 were evaluated
      from the obtained PET images. Furthermore, the specific binding ability of
      promising compounds to the AMPA receptor was evaluated by the PET imaging of
      rats, which we specifically knocked down the expression of AMPA by the
      lentivirus-mediated introduction of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to
      subunits of the AMPA receptor (GluA1-A3). The specific binding ability was also
      evaluated through electrophysiological experiments with acute brain slices.
      RESULTS: Some of the synthesized (18)F-labeled candidate compounds showed a
      distribution similar to that of K-2, with reasonable transferability to the
      brain. In addition, from the evaluation of the specific binding ability to the
      AMPA receptor, a promising structure of an (18)F-labeled AMPA PET drug was
      identified. This study also revealed that the alkylation of the sulfonamide group
      of PEPA enhances brain transferability.

TI  - Inhibit progression of coronary artery calcification with vitamin k in
      hemodialysis patients (the iPACK-HD study): a randomized, placebo-controlled
      multi-centre, pilot trial.
LID - gfac191 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfac191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K activates matrix Gla protein (MGP), a key inhibitor of
      vascular calcification. There is a high prevalence of sub-clinical vitamin K
      deficiency in patients with end stage kidney disease. METHODS: A parallel
      randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial designed to determine whether 10 mg of 
      phylloquinone thrice weekly versus placebo modifies coronary artery calcification
      progression over 12 months in patients requiring hemodialysis with a coronary
      artery calcium score (CAC) >/= 30 Agatston units. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 
      NCT01528800). The primary outcome was feasibility (recruitment rate, compliance
      with study medication, study completion, and adherence overall to study
      protocol). CAC score was used to assess calcification at baseline and 12 months. 
      Secondary objectives were to explore the impact of phylloquinone on vitamin
      K-related biomarkers (phylloquinone, dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP and the
      Gla-osteocalcin to Glu-osteocalcin ratio) and events of clinical interest.
      RESULTS: Eighty-six patients with a CAC score >/= 30 Agatston units were
      randomized to either 10 mg of phylloquinone or matching placebo three times per
      week. Sixty-nine participants (80%) completed the trial. Recruitment rate (4.4
      participants/month) and medication compliance (96%) met pre-defined feasibility
      criteria of >/= 4.17 and >/= 90%, respectively. Patients randomized to
      phylloquinone for 12 months had significantly reduced levels of
      dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP (86% reduction) and increased levels of
      phylloquinone and Gla-osteocalcin to Glu-osteocalcin ratio compared to placebo.
      There was no difference in absolute or relative progression of coronary artery
      calcification between groups. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that phylloquinone
      treatment improves vitamin K status and that a fully powered randomized trial may
      be feasible.

TI  - Na+/K+ ATPase alpha1 and beta3 subunits are localized to the basolateral membrane
      of trophectoderm cells in human blastocysts.
PG  - 1423-1430
LID - 10.1093/humrep/deac124 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is there a relation between specific Na+/K+ ATPase isoform
      expression and localization in human blastocysts and the developmental behavior
      of the embryo? SUMMARY ANSWER: Na+/K+ ATPase alpha1, beta1 and beta3 are the main
      isoforms expressed in human blastocysts and no association was found between the 
      expression level of their respective mRNAs and the rate of blastocyst expansion. 
      WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In mouse embryos, Na+/K+ ATPase alpha1 and beta1 are
      expressed in the basolateral membrane of trophectoderm (TE) cells and are
      believed to be involved in blastocoel formation (cavitation). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE,
      DURATION: A total of 20 surplus embryos from 11 patients who underwent IVF and
      embryo transfer at a university hospital between 2009 and 2018 were analyzed.
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: After freezing and thawing Day 5 human 
      blastocysts, their developmental behavior was observed for 24 h using time-lapse 
      imaging, and the expression of Na+/K+ ATPase isoforms was examined using
      quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The expressed isoforms were then localized in
      blastocysts using fluorescent immunostaining. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF
      CHANCE: RT-qPCR results demonstrated the expression of Na+/K+ ATPase alpha1,
      beta1 and beta3 isoforms in human blastocysts. Isoforms alpha1 and beta3 were
      localized to the basolateral membrane of TE cells, and beta1 was localized
      between TE cells. A high level of beta3 mRNA expression correlated with easier
      hatching (P = 0.0261). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:
      The expression of mRNA and the localization of proteins of interest were
      verified, but we have not been able to perform functional analysis. WIDER
      IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Of the various Na+/K+ ATPase isoforms, expression
      levels of the alpha1, beta1 and beta3 mRNAs were clearly higher than other
      isoforms in human blastocysts. Since alpha1 and beta3 were localized to the
      basolateral membrane via fluorescent immunostaining, we believe that these
      subunits contribute to the dilation of the blastocoel. The beta1 isoform is
      localized between TE cells and may be involved in tight junction formation, as
      previously reported in mouse embryos. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This
      work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI

TI  - Determinants of trafficking, conduction, and disease within a K(+) channel
      revealed through multiparametric deep mutational scanning.

AB  - A long-standing goal in protein science and clinical genetics is to develop
      quantitative models of sequence, structure, and function relationships to
      understand how mutations cause disease. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a
      promising strategy to map how amino acids contribute to protein structure and
      function and to advance clinical variant interpretation. Here, we introduce 7429 
      single-residue missense mutations into the inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.1
      and determine how this affects folding, assembly, and trafficking, as well as
      regulation by allosteric ligands and ion conduction. Our data provide
      high-resolution information on a cotranslationally folded biogenic unit,
      trafficking and quality control signals, and segregated roles of different
      structural elements in fold stability and function. We show that Kir2.1 surface
      trafficking mutants are underrepresented in variant effect databases, which has
      implications for clinical practice. By comparing fitness scores with
      expert-reviewed variant effects, we can predict the pathogenicity of 'variants of
      unknown significance' and disease mechanisms of known pathogenic mutations. Our
      study in Kir2.1 provides a blueprint for how multiparametric DMS can help us
      understand the mechanistic basis of genetic disorders and the structure-function 
      relationships of proteins.

LID - 10.2174/1389201023666220527110455 [doi]
AB  - Recent reports show coagulopathy as a potential complication and poorer outcome
      of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in those with comorbid
      conditions such as diabetes and hypertension as thrombosis could result in stroke
      and heart attacks. Indeed, cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 accounts for 
      40% of mortality. Although there is no standard treatment protocol or guidelines 
      for COVID-19, it is a common practice to use anti-inflammatory corticosteroids
      and anti-coagulants, especially for severe COVID-19 patients. It has also been
      confirmed that deficiencies in vitamin D and/or vitamin K can exacerbate
      premorbid cardiovascular and diabetes conditions associated with COVID-19, at
      least partially due to higher incidence of coagulopathy. Here, we discuss the
      roles of vitamins D and K and their roles in COVID-19-related coagulopathy.
      Moreover, suggestion for proper supplementations of these vitamins in countering 
      COVID-19 is provided.

TI  - Career Research Performance Among Radiology Early Career Grant Recipients
      Compared With National Institutes of Health K Award Recipients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare academic and demographic metrics among recipients of three 
      major early career radiology, interventional radiology, and radiation oncology
      grants to National Institutes of Health (NIH) K awardees at the time the grants
      were awarded and then over the course of their careers. METHODS: Radiologists who
      received the RSNA Research Scholar Grant, General Electric Radiology Research
      Academic Fellowship (GERRAF), American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS) Scholar Award,
      or NIH Career Development (K) Award before January 1, 2015, were included.
      Research metrics at the time of grant award (eg, publications) and subsequent
      scholarly productivity (eg, academic rank, h-index, NIH funding) were recorded
      until April 2020. Wilcoxon ranked-sum, chi(2), logistic regression, and standard 
      least-square regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: There were 279
      recipients: 48 K Award, 115 RSNA Research Scholar Grant, 36 ARRS, and 80 GERRAF. 
      At the time of grant awarding, GERRAF recipients were less likely to have an
      MD-PhD degree (odds ratio [OR]: 0.36; P = .002) and were more likely to be women 
      (OR: 1.55; P = .042) than K Award recipients. Similarly, recipients of the ARRS
      (OR: 2.87; P = .010) and GERRAF (OR: 3.19; P = .002) were more likely to have a
      master's degree. Academic rank, leadership positions, and R01 funding were
      significant predictors of h-index and total publications over time. Academic rank
      and the GERRAF were significant predictors of subsequent NIH funding duration but
      there were no significant predictors of NIH funding amount. CONCLUSIONS: Early
      career radiology awards, specifically the GERRAF, provide support for female and 
      non-PhD investigators and result in comparable academic performance metrics to
      NIH K Award recipients.

AB  - Retinal neurons spend most of their energy to support the transmembrane movement 
      of ions. Light-induced electrical activity is associated with a redistribution of
      ions, which affects the energy demand and results in a change in metabolism.
      Light-induced metabolic changes are expected to be different in distal and
      proximal retina due to differences in the light responses of different retinal
      cells. Extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)]o) is a reliable indicator of
      local electrophysiological activity, and the purpose of this work was to compare 
      [K(+)]o changes evoked by steady and flickering light in distal and proximal
      retina. Data were obtained from isolated mouse (C57Bl/6J) retinae.
      Double-barreled K(+)-selective microelectrodes were used to simultaneously record
      [K(+)]o and local ERGs. In the distal retina, photoreceptor hyperpolarization led
      to suppression of ion transfer, a decrease in [K(+)]o by 0.3-0.5 mM, reduced
      energy demand, and, as previously shown in vivo, decreased metabolism. Flickering
      light had the same effect on [K(+)]o in the distal retina as steady light of
      equivalent illumination. The conductance and voltage changes in postreceptor
      neurons are cell-specific, but the overall effect of steady light in the proximal
      retina is excitation, which is reflected in a [K(+)]o increase there (by a
      maximum of 0.2 mM). In steady light the [K(+)]o increase lasts only 1-2 s, but a 
      sustained [K(+)]o increase is evoked by flickering light. A squarewave low
      frequency (1 Hz) flicker of photopic intensity produced the largest increases in 
      [K(+)]o. Judging by measurements of [K(+)]o, steady illumination decreases energy
      metabolism in the distal retina, but not in the proximal retina (except for the
      first few seconds). Flickering light evokes the same decrease in the distal
      retina, but also evokes a sustained [K(+)]o increase in the proximal retina,
      suggesting an increase of metabolic demand there, especially at 1 Hz, when
      neurons of both on- and off-pathways appear to contribute maximally. This
      proximal retinal metabolic response to flicker correlates to the increase in
      blood flow during flicker that constitutes neurovascular coupling.

TI  - Relationship Amongst Vitamin K Status, Vitamin K Antagonist Use and
      Osteoarthritis: A Review.
PG  - 487-504
LID - 10.1007/s40266-022-00945-y [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K is essential for the carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins 
      that are responsible for the suppression of matrix calcification. The use of
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with cardiovascular diseases could
      affect protein carboxylation and lead to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). 
      This review aims to summarise the current evidence for the relationship between
      VKAs and OA. The literature search revealed that in observation studies, good
      vitamin K status, as reflected by the circulating level or protein carboxylation 
      status of vitamin K, is associated positively with improved joint structural and 
      functional indices and negatively associated with OA incidence. By contrast, in
      limited retrospective and prospective studies, the use of VKAs is associated
      positively with OA occurrence and knee/hip replacement. Pharmacological
      interactions between VKAs and various OA therapeutic agents exist and require
      careful monitoring and dosing. In conclusion, further epidemiological studies are
      warranted to verify the relationship between VKA use and OA to strengthen the
      evidence. Given that VKA use exerts potentially negative effects on joint health,
      intervention is required to protect the quality of life and mobility of patients.

      on BaTiO3 nanocatalysts at low temperatures in the range of 300-1000 K.

LID - 10.1039/d2nr00883a [doi]
AB  - Carbon utilization techniques to mitigate the impact on global warming are an
      important field in environmental science. CO2 reduction is a significant step for
      carbon utilization. However, CO2 reduction with less energy consumption has major
      challenges. In this study, CO2 thermal reduction was demonstrated using
      nanocatalysts at temperatures lower than 1000 K, and the CO2 sorption and
      reduction mechanisms within the temperature range of 300-1000 K were evaluated.
      The physical adsorption on nanocatalysts with a crystal size of 7.4 +/- 0.4 nm
      (10 nm-nanocatalysts) majorly occurred at 300 K and was considerably decreased
      beyond that temperature. CO2 chemisorption occurred above 450 K and subsequent
      CO2 reduction occurred above 500 K, which was expected based on the
      temperature-programmed reaction. CO2 reduction decreased above 900 K by the
      deactivation of the 10-nm nanocatalyst as a result of its crystal growth. The
      transmission electron microscopy images also indicated the complete reduction of 
      CO2 into carbon products at 600 and 800 K. Therefore, an optimal condition of CO2
      reduction in the temperature range of 500-800 K. The highly active thermocatalyst
      achieved CO2 reduction into CO and carbon products without any reducing agents
      even at an extremely low temperature (500 K). In summary, temperature-dependent
      CO2 sorption and reduction were observed on the 10-nm nanocatalyst; CO2 physical 
      adsorption at 300-500 K, CO2 chemisorption above 450 K, CO2 reduction at 500-850 
      K, and CO2 and CO releases above 800 K.

TI  - Photoluminescence enhancement of orange-emitting Ca5(PO4)2SiO4:Sm(3+) phosphor
      through charge compensation of A(+) (Li(+), Na(+) and K(+)) ions for white
      light-emitting diodes.
PG  - 8874-8884
LID - 10.1039/d2dt01034h [doi]
AB  - The orange-emitting Ca5-x(PO4)2SiO4:xSm(3+) (C5PSO:Sm(3+)) phosphor was prepared 
      via a simple solid-state method, and the charge compensators A(+) (A = Li, Na and
      K) were codoped into C5PSO:Sm(3+) for improving the luminescence performance. The
      influences of Sm(3+) doping and Sm(3+)/A(+) codoping on the crystal structure and
      the luminescence performance of the C5PSO:Sm(3+) phosphor were investigated in
      detail. The X-ray diffraction results exhibited that all the as-prepared samples 
      were assigned to the standard structure Ca5(PO4)2SiO4 possessing the P63/m space 
      group. Upon near-ultraviolet excitation at 401 nm, the characteristic emission
      peaks of the C5PSO:Sm(3+) phosphors are located at 558 nm, 605 nm and 656 nm,
      respectively, which are derived from the (4)G5/2 --> (6)HJ (J = 5/2, 7/2, and
      9/2) electron transitions of Sm(3+) ions. Furthermore, a significant luminescence
      improvement of the C5PSO:Sm(3+) phosphor was attained through charge compensation
      of codoped A(+) ions, and the emission intensity is enhanced by 1.79-, 1.45-, and
      1.14-fold for K(+), Na(+), and Li(+), respectively. In addition, the actual
      orange-red LED and w-LED fabricated with the as-prepared C5PSO:Sm(3+),K(+)
      phosphor showed excellent optical performance. All the results demonstrated that 
      the C5PSO:Sm(3+),K(+) orange-emitting phosphor could act as a potential
      orange-red component in the w-LEDs illumination field.

PG  - 77-92

AB  - This special issue aims to use historical examples to gain insight into the
      socio-economic impact of, and possibilities of recovery from, the Covid-19
      pandemic for Black communities. We approach this question by comparing the impact
      of the pandemic on Black Britons in the United Kingdom with that of the 2008
      subprime crisis on Black Americans. We find that, in both cases, a pattern of
      racially asymmetric losses and race-neutral policy responses that have
      systematically ignored the disparate losses borne by Black and racial/ethnic
      minority communities. Both patterns are manifestations of these countries'
      institutional racism. Relying on insights from stratification economics and using
      the concept of "racial formation" introduced by Harold Baron in 1985, we show how
      these nations' historical relationships to slavery and imperialism have led to
      different structures of racial control. Our review of U.K. government policy
      includes a critique of the March 2021 report of the U.K. Commission on Race and
      Ethnic Disparities.

AB  - Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has been shown to provide effective
      activation of the spinal cord neurocircuits. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of LIFU in order to alleviate spasticity following spinal
      cord injury (SCI) by activating the spinal neurocircuits and increasing the
      expression of the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2. Adult male Sprague Dawley
      (SD) rats (220-300 g) were randomly divided into a sham control group, a LIFU(-) 
      group, and a LIFU(+) group. The mechanical threshold hold (g) was used to
      evaluate the behavioral characteristics of spasm. Electromyography (EMG) was used
      to assess activation of the spinal cord neurocircuits and muscle spontaneous
      contraction. Spasticity was assessed by frequency-dependent depression (FDD). The
      expression of KCC2 of the lumbar spinal cord was determined via western blot (WB)
      and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The spinal cord neurocircuits were
      activated by LIFU simulation, which significantly reduced the mechanical
      threshold (g), FDD, and EMG recordings (s) after 4 weeks of treatment. WB and IF 
      staining both demonstrated that the expression of KCC2 was reduced in the LIFU(-)
      group (P < 0.05). After 4 weeks of LIFU stimulation, expression of KCC2 had
      significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the LIFU(+) group compared with the LIFU(-)
      group. Thus, we hypothesized that LIFU treatment can alleviate spasticity
      effectively and upregulate the expression of KCC2 in the L4-L5 section of SCI
      rats.

      total of 80 patients with degenerative spinal diseases or vertebral fractures
      were assigned, including 41 patients in the K-wireless MIS PPS system group
      (K-wireless group) and 39 in the control group (K-wire group).The accuracy of the
      screw insertion, screw-insertion time, number of fluoroscopic observations during
      screw insertion, and the incidence of adverse events were compared between the
      K-wireless group and the K-wire group. The accuracy rate was calculated as the
      number of screws with no breach divided by the total number of screws. Results:
      The accuracy rates of screw insertion were 85.7% and 75.0% in the K-wireless and 
      K-wire groups, respectively, with an intergroup difference of 10.7% (95%
      confidence interval: 2.3-19.1%). The K-wireless group demonstrated
      non-inferiority compared with the K-wire group. The mean screw-insertion time was
      significantly shorter in the K-wireless group (2.62 and 2.97 min in the
      K-wireless and K-wire groups, respectively; P=0.005). There were also
      significantly fewer fluoroscopies in the K-wireless group (10.7 and 17.4 in the
      K-wireless and K-wire groups, respectively; P<0.001). There were no
      device-related or study treatment-related adverse events in either group.
      Conclusions: The accuracy of pedicle screw insertion using the K-wireless MIS PPS
      system was not inferior to that of existing products. In terms of safety, no
      product-related or treatment-related adverse events were identified in this study
      and no new safety concerns were noted.

TI  - High Expression of HERV-K (HML-2) Might Stimulate Interferon in COVID-19
      Patients.
LID - 996 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050996 [doi]
AB  - Background. Interferon is a marker of host antiviral immunity, which is
      disordered in COVID-19 patients. ERV can affect the secretion of interferon
      through the cGAS-STING pathway. In this study, we explored whether IFN-I and
      HERV-K (HML-2) were activated in COVID-19 patients and whether there was an
      interaction between them. Methods. We collected blood samples from COVID-19
      patients and healthy controls. We first detected the expression of HERV-K (HML-2)
      gag, env, and pol genes and IFN-I-related genes between patients and healthy
      people by qPCR, synchronously detected VERO cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Then,
      the chromosome distributions of highly expressed HERV-K (HML-2) gag, env, and pol
      genes were mapped by the next-generation sequencing results, and GO analysis was 
      performed on the related genes. Results. We found that the HERV-K (HML-2) gag,
      env, and pol genes were highly expressed in COVID-19 patients and VERO cells
      infected with SARS-CoV-2. The interferon-related genes IFNB1, ISG15, and IFIT1
      were also activated in COVID-19 patients, and GO analysis showed that HERV-K
      (HML-2) can regulate the secretion of interferon. Conclusions. The high
      expression of HERV-K (HML-2) might activate the increase of interferon in
      COVID-19 patients, proving that HERV-K does not only play a negative role in the 
      human body.

TI  - Chitosan-Hyaluronan Nanoparticles for Vinblastine Sulfate Delivery:
      Characterization and Internalization Studies on K-562 Cells.
LID - 942 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14050942 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we developed chitosan/hyaluronan nanoparticles (CS/HY NPs) 
      for tumor targeting with vinblastine sulfate (VBL), that can be directed to the
      CD44 transmembrane receptor, over-expressed in cancer cells. NPs were prepared by
      coating with HY-preformed chitosan/tripolyphosphate (CS/TPP) NPs, or by
      polyelectrolyte complexation of CS with HY. NPs with a mean hydrodynamic radius
      (RH) of 110 nm, 12% polydispersity index and negative zeta potential values were 
      obtained by a direct complexation process. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
      images showed spherical NPs with a non-homogeneous matrix, probably due to a
      random localization of CS and HY interacting chains. The intermolecular
      interactions occurring between CS and HY upon NPs formation were experimentally
      evidenced by micro-Raman (micro-Raman) spectroscopy, through the analysis of the 
      spectral changes of characteristic vibrational bands of HY during NP formation,
      in order to reveal the involvement of specific chemical groups in the process.
      Optimized NP formulation efficiently encapsulated VBL, producing a drug sustained
      release for 20 h. In vitro studies demonstrated a fast internalization of labeled
      CS/HY NPs (within 6 h) on K-562 human myeloid leukemia cells. Pre-saturation of
      CD44 by free HY produced a slowing-down of NP uptake over 24 h, demonstrating the
      need of CD44 for the internalization of HY-based NPs.

TI  - O-Doping Configurations Reduce the Adsorption Energy Barrier of K-Ions to Improve
      the Electrochemical Performance of Biomass-Derived Carbon.
LID - 806 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/mi13050806 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, atomic-doping has been proven to significantly improve the
      electrochemical performance of biomass-derived carbon materials, which is a
      promising modification strategy. Among them, there are relatively few reports
      about O-doping. Here, porous carbon derived from orange peel was prepared by
      simple carbonization and airflow-annealing processes. Under the coordination of
      microstructure and surface groups, the derived carbon had excellent
      electrochemical performance for the K-ion batteries' anode, including a high
      reversible specific capacity of 320.8 mAh/g, high rate performance of 134.6 mAh/g
      at a current density of 2000 mA/g, and a retention rate of 79.5% even after 2000 
      long-term cycles, which shows great application potential. The K-ion storage
      mechanisms in different voltage ranges were discussed by using various
      characterization techniques, that is, the surface adsorbed of K-ionswas in the
      high-potential slope area, and the intercalation behavior corresponded to the
      low-potential quasi-plateau area. In addition, the density functional theory
      calculations further confirmed that O-doping can reduce the adsorption energy
      barrier of K-ions, change the charge density distribution, and promote the K-ion 
      storage. In particular, the surface Faraday reaction between the C=O group and
      K-ions plays an important role in improving the electrochemical properties.

LID - 10.3390/ma15103736 [doi]
AB  - Results of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements of K, Na, Ca, and Mg
      content in liquid media are discussed in the paper. Calibration results show
      correct parameters-linearity and R(2) coefficients of determination at the levels
      of 0.94-0.99. Obtained regression equations have been used to determine K, Na,
      Ca, and Mg concentrations in biological samples with known element content.
      Measurement results showed acceptable, within the expanded standard uncertainty, 
      conformity with their content in the certified materials. Results have been
      supported by multivariate factorial analysis, which was especially effective for 
      Ca and Mg samples. For these elements, factorial analysis allows the application 
      of the whole spectra to obtain quantitative data on the tested samples, in
      contrast to a common method based on the selection of a particular spectral line 
      for the calibration.

TI  - Vitamin K-Dependent Protein Activation: Normal Gamma-Glutamyl Carboxylation and
      Disruption in Disease.
LID - 5759 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23105759 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins undergo an unusual post-translational
      modification, which is the conversion of specific Glu residues to carboxylated
      Glu (Gla). Gla generation is required for the activation of VKD proteins, and
      occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum during their secretion to either the cell
      surface or from the cell. The gamma-glutamyl carboxylase produces Gla using
      reduced vitamin K, which becomes oxygenated to vitamin K epoxide. Reduced vitamin
      K is then regenerated by a vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKORC1), and this
      interconversion of oxygenated and reduced vitamin K is referred to as the vitamin
      K cycle. Many of the VKD proteins support hemostasis, which is suppressed during 
      therapy with warfarin that inhibits VKORC1 activity. VKD proteins also impact a
      broad range of physiologies beyond hemostasis, which includes regulation of
      calcification, apoptosis, complement, growth control, signal transduction and
      angiogenesis. The review covers the roles of VKD proteins, how they become
      activated, and how disruption of carboxylation can lead to disease. VKD proteins 
      contain clusters of Gla residues that form a calcium-binding module important for
      activity, and carboxylase processivity allows the generation of multiple Glas.
      The review discusses how impaired carboxylase processivity results in the
      pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disease.

TI  - Assessing Psychological Impact of COVID-19 among Parents of Children Returning to
      K-12 Schools: A U.S. Based Cross-Sectional Survey.
LID - 775 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10050775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While impacts of the pandemic on family well-being have
      been documented in the literature, little is known about the psychological
      challenges faced by children and their parents as schools reopen after mandated
      closures. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if sending
      children back to in-person school impacts the mental health of parents and the
      perceived mental health of their children. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      descriptive study recruited a nationally representative, non-probability sample
      of parents or guardians (n = 2100) of children attending grades K-12 in the
      United States (U.S.) through a 58-item web-based survey. The univariate,
      bivariate, and multivariate statistical tests were used to analyze the data.
      RESULTS: The mean scores of parental Coronavirus anxiety and Coronavirus
      obsession were significantly different between race/ethnic groups of parents.
      Parents with children going to private schools had significantly higher mean
      scores for Coronavirus anxiety and obsession compared to parents whose children
      are attending public schools. Nearly 55% of parental Coronavirus anxiety was
      explained by the generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, child's vulnerability
      to infection, and school type of the child. Similarly, 52% of parental
      Coronavirus obsession was explained by the generalized anxiety, separation
      anxiety, child's vulnerability to infection, and social phobia of the children.
      CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on psychological
      well-being of parents and their school-going children. Findings of this study
      will inform policy makers in developing targeted interventions to address unique 
      needs of families with school-going children.

TI  - Quantum Incoherence Based Simultaneously on k Bases.
LID - 659 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24050659 [doi]
AB  - Quantum coherence is known as an important resource in many quantum information
      tasks, which is a basis-dependent property of quantum states. In this paper, we
      discuss quantum incoherence based simultaneously on k bases using Matrix Theory
      Method. First, by defining a correlation function m(e,f) of two orthonormal bases
      e and f, we investigate the relationships between sets I(e) and I(f) of
      incoherent states with respect to e and f. We prove that I(e)=I(f) if and only if
      the rank-one projective measurements generated by e and f are identical. We give 
      a necessary and sufficient condition for the intersection I(e)intersection
      operatorI(f) to include a state except the maximally mixed state. Especially, if 
      two bases e and f are mutually unbiased, then the intersection has only the
      maximally mixed state. Secondly, we introduce the concepts of strong incoherence 
      and weak coherence of a quantum state with respect to a set B of k bases and
      propose a measure for the weak coherence. In the two-qubit system, we prove that 
      there exists a maximally coherent state with respect to B when k=2 and it is not 
      the case for k=3.

TI  - Community Partitioning over Feature-Rich Networks Using an Extended K-Means
      Method.
LID - 626 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24050626 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes a meaningful and effective extension of the celebrated
      K-means algorithm to detect communities in feature-rich networks, due to our
      assumption of non-summability mode. We least-squares approximate given matrices
      of inter-node links and feature values, leading to a straightforward extension of
      the conventional K-means clustering method as an alternating minimization
      strategy for the criterion. This works in a two-fold space, embracing both the
      network nodes and features. The metric used is a weighted sum of the squared
      Euclidean distances in the feature and network spaces. To tackle the so-called
      curse of dimensionality, we extend this to a version that uses the cosine
      distances between entities and centers. One more version of our method is based
      on the Manhattan distance metric. We conduct computational experiments to test
      our method and compare its performances with those by competing popular
      algorithms at synthetic and real-world datasets. The cosine-based version of the 
      extended K-means typically wins at the high-dimension real-world datasets. In
      contrast, the Manhattan-based version wins at most synthetic datasets.

      Efficacy Study.
LID - 1245 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12051245 [doi]
AB  - This study demonstrates that students in kindergarten through eighth grade can
      use the XpressCollect nasal swab to self-collect a specimen under the guidance of
      a teacher. This phased study was conducted with parents, teachers, and students. 
      Phases 1 and 2 were conducted as interviews with teachers and parents to assess
      the suitability of the XpressCollect for children in kindergarten through eighth 
      grade. Additionally, teacher and parent feedback was obtained to develop and
      optimize the instructional materials for subsequent phases. In Phases 3 and 4,
      teachers guided small groups and full classes of students through the sample
      collection process with XpressCollect. The samples collected by the students were
      sent to a laboratory to analyze the effectiveness of specimen self-collection
      based on the presence of ribonuclease P (RNase P) on each nasal swab. The
      presence of RNase P enables disease determination; thus, student samples were
      analyzed for adequate or inadequate sampling. All students in kindergarten
      through eighth grade are capable of self-collecting an anterior nares specimen
      with XpressCollect, as the laboratory results identified acceptable RNase P Ct
      values for the samples collected in a classroom setting.

TI  - Zika Virus Envelope Protein Domain III Produced in K. phaffii Has the Potential
      for Diagnostic Applications.
LID - 1198 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12051198 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) represents a global human health threat and it is related to
      severe diseases such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain-Barre
      syndrome (GBS). There is no vaccine available nor specific antiviral treatment,
      so developing sensitive, specific, and low-cost diagnostic tests is necessary.
      Thus, the objective of this work was to produce the Zika virus envelope protein
      domain III (ZIKV-EDIII) in Komagataella phaffii KM71H and evaluate its potential 
      for diagnostic applications. After the K. phaffii had been transformed with the
      pPICZalphaA-ZIKV-EDIII vector, an SDS-PAGE and Western Blot were performed to
      characterize the recombinant protein and an ELISA to evaluate the antigenic
      potential. The results show that ZIKV-EDIII was produced in the expected size,
      with a good purity grade and yield of 2.58 mg/L. The receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve showed 90% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity for IgM, 
      and 93.33% sensitivity and 82.76% specificity for IgG. The ZIKV-EDIII protein was
      efficiently produced in K. phaffi, and it has the potential for diagnostic
      applications.

TI  - Effect of Vitamin K on Bone Mineral Density and Fracture Risk in Adults:
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 1048 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10051048 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have proposed that adequate intake of Vitamin K (VK) is associated
      with a low risk of fracture and high bone mineral density (BMD) to improve
      skeletal health in adults. This systematic review was designed to summarize the
      most relevant and updated evidence discussing the relationship between VK and
      bone. It explores the effect of VK deficiency and its supplementation on various 
      bone parameters. Methods: The distinct databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane
      Library, Google Scholar, National Clinical Trials, Current Controlled Trials, and
      Clinical Trials were searched up to Jan 2020 to identify eligible trials. All
      relevant randomized controlled trial studies with any oral dosage form of VK
      supplement administered for at least six months and assessing BMD or fracture in 
      adults were extracted. Finally, two independent reviewers identified 20 relevant 
      citations for the systematic review and extracted data in tabular form. Results: 
      The meta-analysis was performed with all studies, including postmenopausal and
      osteoporotic females, for both total clinical and vertebral fracture outcomes.
      The quantitative analysis showed that the odds ratios (OR) of any fracture were
      lower for VK as compared to control [OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.66)] for vertebral
      fractures and OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.88) for clinical fracture. For the
      BMD, a meta-analysis of the pooled effect of interventional studies suggested a
      non-significant association between the use of VK and improvement in femoral BMD 
      (CI 95%, p = 0.08 [-0.03-0.20]). Conclusion: VK decreases general fracture risk, 
      and it can be an option to counter bone loss disorders. However, insufficient
      evidence is available regarding the significant impact of VK on femoral neck BMD.
      Therefore, further studies are required to establish the therapeutic value of VK 
      as a treatment for osteoporosis.

TI  - Epidemiological, Clinical and Microbiological Characteristics of Patients with
      Bloodstream Infections Due to Carbapenem-Resistant K. Pneumoniae in Southern
      Italy: A Multicentre Study.
LID - 633 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11050633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study, our aim was to evaluate the clinical and
      microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with bloodstream
      infections (BSI) due to Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and
      investigate the independent predictors of mortality. METHODS: All episodes of
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli (CREc) or K. pneumoniae (CRKp) BSI that were subject
      to a mandatory notification from January to December 2020 in all acute care
      hospitals and long-term care facilities of the Campania region in southern Italy 
      were enrolled. All carbapenem-resistant strains were assessed through molecular
      tests for the presence of five carbapenemase gene families, i.e., K. pneumoniae
      Carbapenemase (KPC), oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48), New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase
      (NDM), Verona integron encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM) and Imipenemase
      (IMP). RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 154 consecutive non-repeated 
      CRE BSI, all due to CRKp, were reported. The most frequently identified genes
      were KPC in 108 cases (70.1%), followed by metallo-betalactamases (MBL) (16.2%), 
      and OXA-48 (2.6%); in 17 isolates (11%) no carbapenemase was detected. The
      overall mortality at 90 days was 41.9%. Using a log-rank test, patients without
      risk factors for CRE infections showed a significantly lower cumulative mortality
      (p = 0.001). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of at 
      least one risk factor was the only predictor of mortality (OR: 1.7, 95% CI
      1.2-6.1, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The study reported a non-negligible prevalence 
      of MBL-producing organisms among CRKp isolated from blood cultures in our region.
      This data highlights the importance of molecular characterization of all clinical
      isolates of carbapenem-resistant organisms.

TI  - Compressed sensing based dynamic MR image reconstruction by using 3D-total
      generalized variation and tensor decomposition: k-t TGV-TD.
PG  - 101
LID - 10.1186/s12880-022-00826-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI) is a promising
      technique to accelerate dynamic cardiac MR imaging (DCMRI). For DCMRI, the CS-MRI
      usually exploits image signal sparsity and low-rank property to reconstruct
      dynamic images from the undersampled k-space data. In this paper, a novel CS
      algorithm is investigated to improve dynamic cardiac MR image reconstruction
      quality under the condition of minimizing the k-space recording. METHODS: The
      sparse representation of 3D cardiac magnetic resonance data is implemented by
      synergistically integrating 3D total generalized variation (3D-TGV) algorithm and
      high order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) based Tensor Decomposition,
      termed k-t TGV-TD method. In the proposed method, the low rank structure of the
      3D dynamic cardiac MR data is performed with the HOSVD method, and the localized 
      image sparsity is achieved by the 3D-TGV method. Moreover, the Fast Composite
      Splitting Algorithm (FCSA) method, combining the variable splitting with operator
      splitting techniques, is employed to solve the low-rank and sparse problem. Two
      different cardiac MR datasets (cardiac perfusion and cine MR datasets) are used
      to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. RESULTS: Compared with the
      state-of-art methods, such as k-t SLR, 3D-TGV, HOSVD based tensor decomposition
      and low-rank plus sparse method, the proposed k-t TGV-TD method can offer
      improved reconstruction accuracy in terms of higher peak SNR (PSNR) and
      structural similarity index (SSIM). The proposed k-t TGV-TD method can achieve
      significantly better and stable reconstruction results than state-of-the-art
      methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM, especially for cardiac perfusion MR
      dataset. CONCLUSIONS: This work proved that the k-t TGV-TD method was an
      effective sparse representation way for DCMRI, which was capable of significantly
      improving the reconstruction accuracy with different acceleration factors.

TI  - The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients-A systematic
      review.
LID - 10.1111/sdi.13098 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for prevention of
      thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This
      study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis
      patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies
      including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control
      trials (RCTs) comparing NOAC with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or no anticoagulant 
      treatment. Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of bias tool were used for
      quality assessment. Twenty studies were identified (nine PK studies, two RCTs,
      and nine cohort studies). Most of the studies investigated apixaban or
      rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban
      and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that
      high dose apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs
      (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and
      bleeding outcomes. Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas
      comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies
      comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) twice daily suggest a 
      lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high 
      dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did
      not lower the risk of stroke compared with non-treated regardless of apixaban
      dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately
      sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and
      rivaroxaban in reduced dose.

PG  - e0268810
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268810 [doi]
AB  - Contagious statistical distributions are a valuable resource for managing
      contagion by means of k-connected chains of distributions. Binomial,
      hypergeometric, Polya, uniform distributions with the same values for all
      parameters except sample size n are known to be strongly associated. This paper
      describes how the relationship can be obtained via factorial moments, simplifying
      the process by including novel elements. We describe the properties of these
      distributions and provide examples of their real-world application, and then
      define a chain of k-connected distributions, which generalises the relationship
      among samples of any size for a given population and the Polya urn model.

TI  - Multi-route exposure sampling of quaternary ammonium compounds and ethanol
      surface disinfectants in a K-8 school.
PG  - e13036
LID - 10.1111/ina.13036 [doi]
AB  - The frequency of surface disinfectant use has increased over the last several
      years in public settings such as schools, especially during the COVID-19
      pandemic. Although these products are important for infection control and
      prevention, their increased use may intensify the exposure to both persons
      applying the disinfection product as well as bystanders. Safety assessments have 
      demonstrated that these products, when used as intended, are considered safe for 
      use and effective; however, point-of-contact effects (such as respiratory or
      dermal irritation) may still occur. Additionally, relative exposures may vary
      significantly due to the wide variation in disinfectant formulation and
      application methods. Quantitative estimations of exposures to two commonly used
      active ingredients, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and ethanol, are not
      well characterized during product use and application scenarios. To assess the
      potential for health risks attributable to increased use in classroom settings,
      as well as to quantitatively evaluate the potential exposure to both ethanol and 
      QACs, student and adult bystander surface and air measurements were collected in 
      a K-8 school setting in Ohio, United States, over a three-day period.
      Direct-reading instruments were utilized to collect real-time air samples that
      characterized mass fraction concentrations following the use of the QAC- and
      ethanol-based disinfectants. Furthermore, surface and air sampling of microbial
      species were conducted to establish the overall bioburden and effectiveness of
      each disinfectant to inform the comparative risk and health effect impacts from
      the tested products use scenario. Both tested products were approximately equally
      effective at reducing bioburdens on desk surfaces. In some classrooms,
      concentrations of QAC congeners were significantly increased on desk surfaces
      following the application of the disinfectant spray; however, the magnitude of
      the change in concentration was small. Ethanol was not measured on surfaces due
      to its volatility. Airborne concentrations increased immediately following spray 
      of each disinfectant product but rapidly returned to baseline. Each of the QAC
      congeners listed in the product safety data sheets were detected and measurable
      on desk surfaces; however, air concentrations were generally below the limit of
      detection. The 15-min time-weighted averages (TWAs) of both QACs and ethanol in
      the air were below respective health effects benchmarks, and therefore, the
      negative impact on health outcomes is considered to be minimal from short-term,
      repeated use of ethanol- or QAC-based spray products in a school setting when the
      products are used as directed.

AB  - Tests of lepton universality in B^{0}-->K_{S}^{0}l^{+}l^{-} and
      B^{+}-->K^{*+}l^{+}l^{-} decays where l is either an electron or a muon are
      presented. The differential branching fractions of B^{0}-->K_{S}^{0}e^{+}e^{-}
      and B^{+}-->K^{*+}e^{+}e^{-} decays are measured in intervals of the dilepton
      invariant mass squared. The measurements are performed using proton-proton
      collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated
      luminosity of 9 fb^{-1} . The results are consistent with the standard model and 
      previous tests of lepton universality in related decay modes. The first
      observation of B^{0}-->K_{S}^{0}e^{+}e^{-} and B^{+}-->K^{*+}e^{+}e^{-} decays is
      reported.

TI  - A New Antirotation Strategy of K-Wire Tension Band Therapy for Patellar Fracture.
PG  - 891869
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.891869 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patellar fracture is a common phenomenon observed in orthopedic
      clinics. Many methods have been shown to be effective in the fixation of patellar
      fracture. However, there are few studies on the antirotation effect of these
      methods. The purpose of this study is to present a new strategy of K-wire tension
      band therapy for patellar fracture and explore the antirotation effect of the
      modified tension band method on patellar fracture. Methods: A retrospective
      clinical observation study was conducted on 75 patients with patellar fracture.
      Totally, 46 patients were enrolled to the traditional group, who received the
      traditional K-wire tension band therapy. The modified group included 29 patients 
      on whom our new strategy was implemented. The operation time, intraoperative
      blood loss, and fracture healing time were collected to compare the two
      operations and the knee society score (KSS) scores after the operations, and
      complications were recorded and retrieved to indicate the effectiveness of the
      two treatments. Results: The preoperative baseline data (gender, age, fracture
      types) of the two groups showed no significant statistical difference. Similarly,
      there was no significant difference in the operation time, intraoperative blood
      loss, and fracture healing time between the two groups. The KSS clinical scores 1
      year after operation was 90 (84, 95) for the traditional group as compared with
      99 (97, 100) for the modified group (p < 0.05). The KSS functional scores 1 year 
      after operation in the two groups were 90 (65, 90) and 100 (90, 100) (p < 0.05). 
      The incidences of complications due to the rotation of K-wires in the traditional
      group and the modified group were 76.1% (35 of 46) and 6.9% (2 of 29) with a
      significant statistical difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that 
      our modified tension band therapy is an effective strategy for antirotation in
      the treatment of patellar fracture and proves that it can achieve better clinical
      outcomes than the traditional K-wire tension band method. This new strategy may
      be a safe and effective clinical technique for the treatment of patellar
      fracture. However, more prospective randomized controlled trials with larger
      sample sizes are still needed to further prove its efficacy.

TI  - Association between mitochondrial DNA haplogroups J and K, serum branched-chain
      amino acids and lowered capability for endurance exercise.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s13102-022-00485-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endurance exercise training promotes the catabolism of branched-chain
      amino acids (BCAAs) in skeletal muscles. We have previously shown that
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups J and K are markers of low responders in
      endurance training. In this paper, we hypothesize that BCAA catabolism is a
      surrogate marker of lower respiratory chain activity attributed to these
      haplogroups. We evaluated whether exercise-induced changes in amino acid
      concentrations differ between subjects harbouring mtDNA haplogroups J or K and
      those with non-JK haplogroups. METHODS: Finnish male conscripts (N = 633)
      undertook the 12-min Cooper running test at the beginning and end of their
      military service. The intervention during the service mainly included endurance
      aerobic exercise and sports-related muscle training. Concentrations of seven
      amino acids were analysed in the serum using a high-throughput (1)H NMR
      metabolomics platform. Total DNA was extracted from whole blood, and restriction 
      fragment analysis was used to determine mtDNA haplogroups J and K. RESULTS: The
      concentrations of the seven amino acids were higher following the intervention,
      with the exception of phenylalanine; interestingly, the increase in the
      concentrations of three BCAAs was larger in subjects with haplogroup J or K than 
      in subjects with non-JK haplogroups (p = 0.029). MtDNA haplogroups J and K share 
      two common nonsynonymous variants. Structural analysis based on crystallographic 
      data on bovine complexes I and III revealed that the Leu18 variant in cytochrome 
      b encoded by m.14798T > C may interfere with ubiquinone binding at the Qi site in
      complex III. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the concentrations of serum BCAAs
      following exercise intervention differs between subjects harbouring mtDNA
      haplogroup J or K and those harbouring non-JK haplogroups. Lower response in
      endurance training and difference in exercise-induced increase in the
      concentrations of serum BCAAs suggest decreased respiratory chain activity.
      Haplogroups J and K share m.14798T > C in MT-CYB, which may hamper the function
      of complex III.

TI  - Vitamin-K-antagonist phenprocoumon versus low-dose direct oral anticoagulants
      (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation: a real-world analysis of German
      claims data.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/s12959-022-00389-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF),
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been increasingly prescribed instead of
      vitamin-K-antagonists (VKA). For some patients a lower dosage of DOACs (ld-DOACs)
      is recommended. Ld-DOAC prescribing seems to be common, although previous studies
      did not show clear superiority of ld-DOACs over warfarin. In Germany,
      phenprocoumon is used almost exclusively as VKA. Randomized controlled trials
      comparing DOACs and phenprocoumon in the general population of patients with AF
      do not exist. Therefore, we aimed to compare ld-DOACs and phenprocoumon in a
      real-world setting in Germany. METHODS: In a retrospective observational cohort
      study, claims data from a group of small to medium-sized health insurance
      companies were analysed. Risks for the outcomes thromboembolism, death and major 
      bleeding were estimated by Cox regression. Out of 93,685 patients with atrial
      fibrillation and a first prescription of an oral anticoagulant, 20,179 receiving 
      VKA and 21,724 ld-DOACs (29.6% of all DOAC patients) were included. For the
      sensitivity analysis phenprocoumon was compared to the five ld-DOAC groups
      (ld-apixaban, ld-dabigatran, ld-edoxaban, ld-rivaroxaban, and the composite of
      all ld-DOACs) after propensity-score matching. RESULTS: Phenprocoumon was
      associated with statistically significant fewer thromboembolic events (HR = 1.29,
      95% CI [1.13, 1.48], p < .001) and deaths (HR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.41, 1.63], p <
      .001) and a non-significant higher bleeding risk (HR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.79, 1.00],
      p = .051) than composite ld-DOAC. Regarding the subgroups, only patients with
      ld-apixaban had a statistically significant higher risk for thromboembolic events
      (HR = 1.42, 95% CI [1.21, 1.65], p < .001) and a lower bleeding risk (HR = 0.75, 
      95% CI [0.65, 0.86], p < .001). Ld-apixaban, ld-edoxaban, and ld-rivaroxaban were
      associated with a higher risk of death. The sensitivity analysis confirmed these 
      associations. CONCLUSION: Phenprocoumon seems to be superior to ld-DOACs for
      patients with AF. As a hypothesis phenprocoumon might turn out to be the wiser
      choice for high-risk patients with AF as compared to ld-DOACs, especially
      regarding thromboembolic events and death. Therefore, RCTs comparing ld-DOACs
      with phenprocoumon are needed.

TI  - The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived physical activity,

AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants, continue to spread globally more than
      two years after the discovery of the wild-type virus in Wuhan, China. Following
      the onset of COVID-19, fluctuating restrictions have likely impacted the daily
      lives of older adults living in the United Kingdom (UK). Subsequently, the longer
      term effects of COVID-19 on physical activity levels, perceived physical function
      and mood of older adults are unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to
      follow a group of older adult's living in the UK for one year, to monitor
      physical activity levels, perceived physical function and mood. A longitudinal,
      mixed-methods, observational study was conducted using self-administered, online 
      surveys at 3-month intervals between March 2020 and June 2021. A total of 100
      participants (46 males [age: 76 +/- 5 years] and 54 females [age:74 +/- 4 years])
      completed all surveys. Bayesian analysis allowed calculation of direct
      probabilities whilst incorporating our prior knowledge. Throughout this period,
      older adults maintained or increased their pre-lockdown physical activity levels 
      despite a decrease in intensity of effort of physical activity tasks, whilst
      sitting time increased at two of the follow-up time-points. Furthermore,
      perceived physical function decreased (ps = 91.78%;>1.21 AU) and mood undulated
      in a pattern that reflected the tightening and easing of restrictions. Despite
      total physical activity being maintained, perceived physical function decreased
      by a small but clinically meaningful margin.

AB  - Reports related to Camellia weiningensis Y.K. Li. are rare. We evaluated the
      economic characteristics of the mature fruit of 45 superior C. weiningensis trees
      using principal component analysis (PCA) and gray correlation analysis, and
      identified excellent germplasms according to performance. PCA was employed to
      reduce the dimensions. PCA was performed for the original 15 indices of fruit
      diameter, fruit length, fruit shape, single-fruit weight, pericarp thickness, oil
      yield, fresh seed rate, dry seed rate, dry kernel rate and palmitic acid, stearic
      acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid contents.
      According to the requirements of a cumulative contribution rate >/= 80% and an
      eigenvector value > 1, six principle components were selected. These indices
      underwent weighted summation to establish a function model for comprehensive
      evaluation. Finally, the comprehensive rankings of the cultivars according to PCA
      were compared with those according to gray correlation analysis. The genetic
      variation coefficients of the 15 parameters ranged from 2.24% (oleic acid
      content) to 22.70% (single-fruit weight, with a range of 21.34 g). The top ten
      excellent cultivars with the highest comprehensive scores according to PCA and
      those according to gray correlation analysis were compared. According to PCA,
      oleic acid content, fruit diameter, fruit length, pericarp thickness, arachidonic
      acid content and dry seed rate can serve as representative evaluation indicators 
      of C. weiningensis. The outcomes obtained based on PCA were basically consistent 
      with those obtained based on gray correlation analysis. Finally, nine excellent
      cultivars were finally determined, i.e., WY-1, WY-6, WY-8, WY-25, WY-27, WY-30,
      WY-33, WY-35, WY-38 and WY-44. The results obtained in terms of crown yield were 
      basically consistent with the outcomes of the comprehensive assessments, which
      indicates the reliability of the assessment methods used in this study.

AB  - A benchmark computational study of K-edge core-ionization energies of third-row
      elements using relativistic delta-coupled-cluster (DeltaCC) methods and a revised
      core-valence separation (CVS) scheme is reported. High-level relativistic (HLR)
      corrections beyond the spin-free exact two-component theory in its one-electron
      variant (SFX2C-1e), including the contributions from two-electron picture-change 
      effects, spin-orbit coupling, the Breit term, and quantum electrodynamics
      effects, have been taken into account and demonstrated to play an important role.
      Relativistic DeltaCC calculations are shown to provide accurate results for
      core-ionization energies of third-row elements. The SFX2C-1e-CVS-DeltaCC results 
      augmented with HLR corrections show a maximum deviation of less than 0.5 eV with 
      respect to experimental values.

AB  - Ginsenosides, as the most important constituents of ginseng, have been
      extensively investigated in cancer chemoprevention and therapeutics. Among the
      ginsenosides, Compound K (CK), a rare protopanaxadiol type of ginsenoside, has
      been most broadly used for cancer treatment due to its high anticancer
      bioactivity. However, the functional mechanism of CK in cancer is not well known.
      This review describes the structure, transformation and pharmacological activity 
      of CK and discusses the functional mechanisms of CK and its metabolites, which
      regulate signaling pathways related to tumor growth and metastasis. CK inhibits
      tumor growth by inducing tumor apoptosis and tumor cell differentiation,
      regulates the tumor microenvironment by suppressing tumor angiogenesis-related
      proteins, and downregulates the roles of immunosuppressive cells, such as
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). There is currently much research on the
      potential development of CK as a new strategy when administered alone or in
      combination with other compounds.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants vs. Vitamin K Antagonists in Atrial Fibrillation
      Patients at Risk of Falling: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 833329
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.833329 [doi]
AB  - Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin are usually used for 
      people with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, for the AF patients at risk of
      falling, the effectiveness and safety outcomes of DOACs compared with warfarin
      remain unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis regarding the
      effectiveness and safety of DOACs vs. warfarin in AF patients at risk of falling.
      Methods: A search of the PubMed and Embase databases until November 2021 was
      performed. We included studies if they satisfied the following criteria: (1)
      study type: randomized clinical trials or observational cohort studies. (2)
      Comparisons: effectiveness and/or safety of DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
      apixaban, or edoxaban) compared with warfarin. (3) Study data: the sample size,
      the number of events in the VKAs or DOACs groups, adjusted risk ratios (RRs), and
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). (4) Study outcomes: stroke or systemic embolism
      (SSE), ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause death, and
      cardiovascular death; major bleeding, major or clinically relevant non-major
      (CRNM) bleeding, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and any
      bleeding. (5) Study population: patients at risk of falling. According to the
      Morse Fall Scale, the risk of falling relates to the history of falling,
      secondary diagnosis, ambulatory aids, intravenous therapy, type of gait, and
      mental status. In this meta-analysis, if the patient's MFS score is >/=25 points,
      he will be thought of as having the risk of falling. The adjusted risk ratios
      (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by a random-effects model
      with an inverse variance method. Results: Three cohort studies were included in
      our study. For the effectiveness outcomes, the use of DOACs was only associated
      with a significantly reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR = 0.28,
      95%CI:0.10-0.75) compared with warfarin, but there were no significant
      differences in stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) (RR = 0.87, 95%CI:0.70-1.08),
      cardiovascular death (RR = 0.97, 95%CI:0.73-1.29) and all-cause death (RR = 0.90,
      95%CI:0.72-1.11). For the safety outcomes, the use of DOACs was significantly
      associated with reduced risks of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding 
      (RR = 0.77, 95%CI:0.61-0.98) and intracranial bleeding (RR = 0.26,
      95%CI:0.11-0.66) but not major bleeding (RR = 0.78, 95%CI:0.58-1.06).
      Conclusions: Compared with warfarin, the use of DOACs in AF patients at risk of
      falling is significantly associated with reduced risks of hemorrhagic stroke,
      major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding.

TI  - Multiple Cantilever K-wiring Technique for Severely Comminuted Articular
      Fragments in Neglected Distal Humerus Fracture with Anterior Elbow Dislocation: A
      Case Report.
PG  - 22-25
LID - 10.13107/jocr.2022.v12.i01.2600 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Anterior dislocation of the elbow is comparatively less frequent
      and is often associated with fractures of the distal humerus. Such injuries
      require surgical intervention at the earliest but with the surge of COVID-19
      pandemic and different protocols being followed by surgeons, such cases are
      getting neglected. We present a 5-week-old neglected anterior dislocation of the 
      right elbow joint with lateral condyle and medial epicondyle humerus fracture and
      a unique cantilever K-wiring technique used for its treatment. Case Presentation:
      A 30-year-old man presented with pain, deformity, and limited range of movement
      of his right elbow joint and a non-healing wound over the olecranon after he had 
      a road traffic accident 5 weeks back. The patient had been initially treated in a
      local hospital where he tested positive for COVID-19 and was managed
      conservatively. Radiographs revealed lateral condyle and medial epicondyle
      humerus fracture and an unreduced anterior dislocation of the right elbow joint. 
      Conclusion: Neglected fracture-dislocation of the elbow is challenging and is
      further complicated by comminuted fragments with loss of bone stock. A unique use
      of multiple Kirschner wires in a cantilever fashion provides a good fixation
      alternative for such cases.

AB  - Environmental perturbations impact multiple cellular traits, including gene
      expression. Bacteria respond to these stressful situations through complex gene
      interaction networks, thereby inducing stress tolerance and survival of cells. In
      this paper, we study the response mechanisms of E. coli when exposed to different
      environmental stressors via differential expression and co-expression analysis.
      Gene co-expression networks were generated and analyzed via Weighted Gene
      Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Based on the gene co-expression networks,
      genes with similar expression profiles were clustered into modules. The modules
      were analysed for identification of hub genes, enrichment of biological processes
      and transcription factors. In addition, we also studied the link between
      transcription factors and their differentially regulated targets to understand
      the regulatory mechanisms involved. These networks validate known gene
      interactions and provide new insights into genes mediating transcriptional
      regulation in specific stress environments, thus allowing for in silico
      hypothesis generation.

TI  - On Consistent Entropy-Regularized k-Means Clustering With Feature Weight
      Learning: Algorithm and Statistical Analyses.
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2022.3166975 [doi]
AB  - Clusters in real data are often restricted to low-dimensional subspaces rather
      than the entire feature space. Recent approaches to circumvent this difficulty
      are often computationally inefficient and lack theoretical justification in terms
      of their large-sample behavior. This article deals with the problem by
      introducing an entropy incentive term to efficiently learn the feature importance
      within the framework of center-based clustering. A scalable block-coordinate
      descent algorithm, with closed-form updates, is incorporated to minimize the
      proposed objective function. We establish theoretical guarantees on our method by
      Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory to establish strong consistency along with
      uniform concentration bounds. The merits of our method are showcased through
      detailed experimental analysis on toy examples as well as real data clustering
      benchmarks.

TI  - Differential ion dehydration energetics explains selectivity in the non-canonical
      lysosomal K(+) channel TMEM175.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.75122 [doi]
LID - e75122 [pii]
AB  - Structures of the human lysosomal K(+) channel transmembrane protein 175
      (TMEM175) in open and closed states revealed a novel architecture lacking the
      canonical K(+) selectivity filter motif present in previously known K(+) channel 
      structures. A hydrophobic constriction composed of four isoleucine residues was
      resolved in the pore and proposed to serve as the gate in the closed state, and
      to confer ion selectivity in the open state. Here, we achieve higher-resolution
      structures of the open and closed states and employ molecular dynamics
      simulations to analyze the conducting properties of the putative open state,
      demonstrating that it is permeable to K(+) and, to a lesser degree, also Na(+).
      Both cations must dehydrate significantly to penetrate the narrow hydrophobic
      constriction, but ion flow is assisted by a favorable electrostatic field
      generated by the protein that spans the length of the pore. The balance of these 
      opposing energetic factors explains why permeation is feasible, and why TMEM175
      is selective for K(+) over Na(+), despite the absence of the canonical
      selectivity filter. Accordingly, mutagenesis experiments reveal an exquisite
      sensitivity of the channel to perturbations that mitigate the constriction.
      Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism for selective permeation of ions by
      TMEM175 that is unlike that of other K(+) channels.

TI  - A Slice-Low-Rank Plus Sparse (slice-L + S) Reconstruction Method for k-t
      Undersampled Multiband First-Pass Myocardial Perfusion MRI.
PG  - 1140-1155
LID - 10.1002/mrm.29281 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The synergistic use of k-t undersampling and multiband (MB) imaging has 
      the potential to provide extended slice coverage and high spatial resolution for 
      first-pass perfusion MRI. The low-rank plus sparse (L + S) model has shown
      excellent performance for accelerating single-band (SB) perfusion MRI. METHODS: A
      MB data consistency method employing ESPIRiT maps and through-plane coil
      information was developed. This data consistency method was combined with the
      temporal L + S constraint to form the slice-L + S method. Slice-L + S was
      compared to SB L + S and the sequential operations of split slice-GRAPPA and SB L
      + S (seq-SG-L + S) using synthetic data formed from multislice SB images.
      Prospectively k-t undersampled MB data were also acquired and reconstructed using
      seq-SG-L + S and slice-L + S. RESULTS: Using synthetic data with total
      acceleration rates of 6-12, slice-L + S outperformed SB L + S and seq-SG-L + S (N
      = 7 subjects) with respect to normalized RMSE and the structural similarity index
      (P < 0.05 for both). For the specific case with MB factor = 3 and rate 3
      undersampling, or for SB imaging with rate 9 undersampling (N = 7 subjects), the 
      normalized RMSE values were 0.037 +/- 0.007, 0.042 +/- 0.005, and 0.031 +/-
      0.004; and the structural similarity index values were 0.88 +/- 0.03, 0.85 +/-
      0.03, and 0.89 +/- 0.02 for SB L + S, seq-SG-L + S, and slice-L + S, respectively
      (P < 0.05 for both). For prospectively undersampled MB data, slice-L + S provided
      better image quality than seq-SG-L + S for rate 6 (N = 7) and rate 9 acceleration
      (N = 7) as scored by blinded experts. CONCLUSION: Slice-L + S outperformed SB-L +
      S and seq-SG-L + S and provides 9 slice coverage of the left ventricle with a
      spatial resolution of 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm with good image quality.

AB  - Background: Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are class I oral anticoagulants that are
      widely prescribed following surgical heart valve implantation. The objective of
      this study was to quantify the relative effects of VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2
      genotypes in predicting VKA dosing. Materials & methods: A total of 506 South
      Indian patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who were prescribed oral 
      VKAs, such as warfarin or acenocoumarol, were genotyped. The discriminatory
      ability of mutant genotypes to predict dose categories and bleeding events was
      assessed using regression analysis. Results: The VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP2C9*3 and
      CYP4F2*3 mutant genotypes significantly influenced VKA-dose requirements and
      explained 27.47% of the observed dose variation. Conclusion: These results
      support pharmacogenetic screening for initial VKA dosing among South Indian
      patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves.

TI  - Effect of ginkgolide K on calcium channel activity in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 426
LID - 10.3892/etm.2022.11353 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia with the key
      pathological hallmark of amyloid deposits that may induce mitochondrial
      dysfunction. Ginkgolide K (GK) has been proven to have neuroprotective effects.
      The present study sought to explore the neuroprotective effect of GK through
      regulation of the expression of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) in the
      pathology of AD. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured and the expression of MCU was
      enhanced by transfection of MCU recombinant vectors or knockdown by MCU small
      interfering RNA. The cells were treated with GK and amyloid beta (Abeta).
      Thereafter, the effects of GK, MCU expression and Abeta on viability and
      apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells were examined via a WST-1 assay, flow cytometry and
      Caspase-3/8 activity assays, respectively. The effects of GK, MCU expression and 
      Abeta on the calcium levels in mitochondria were also examined. The regulatory
      effect of GK on MCU expression was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative
      PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore, APP/PS1 mice received supplementation
      with GK and their cognitive ability was then examined through water maze tests,
      while the expression of MCU was examined using immunohistochemistry. The results 
      indicated that enhancing the expression of MCU inhibited cell viability and
      promoted apoptosis. GK protected cells from amyloid-induced cytotoxicity by
      promoting cell viability and preventing cell apoptosis. The neuroprotective
      effect of GK was abolished when MCU expression was knocked down. GK decreased the
      expression of MCU in vitro and downregulation of MCU decreased the calcium level 
      in mitochondria. Treatment with GK in APP/PS1 mice downregulated the expression
      of MCU in the brains and alleviated cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the
      present study demonstrated that the administration of GK protected neurons by
      preventing apoptosis. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of GK in neuronal
      cells was indicated to be related to the inhibition of MCU expression. Therefore,
      administration of GK may be a promising strategy for treating AD.

TI  - Tuning band gap and enhancing optical functions of AGeF3 (A = K, Rb) under
      pressure for improved optoelectronic applications.
PG  - 8663
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12713-4 [doi]
AB  - The current study diligently analyzes the physical characteristics of halide
      perovskites AGeF3 (A = K, Rb) under hydrostatic pressure using density functional
      theory. The goal of this research is to reduce the electronic band gap of AGeF3
      (A = K, Rb) under pressure in order to improve the optical characteristics and
      assess the compounds' suitability for optoelectronic applications. The structural
      parameters exhibit a high degree of precision, which correlates well with
      previously published work. In addition, the bond length and lattice parameters
      decrease significantly leading to a stronger interaction between atoms. The
      bonding between K(Rb)-F and Ge-F reveal ionic and covalent nature, respectively, 
      and the bonds become stronger under pressure. The application of hydrostatic
      pressure demonstrates remarkable changes in the optical absorption and
      conductivity. The band gap becomes lower with the increment of pressure,
      resulting in better conductivity. The optical functions also predict that the
      studied materials might be used in a variety of optoelectronic devices operating 
      in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. Interestingly, the compounds become more
      suitable to be used in optoelectronic applications under pressure. Moreover, the 
      external pressure has profound dominance on the mechanical behavior of the titled
      perovskites, which make them more ductile and anisotropic.

PG  - 2863
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-30454-w [doi]
AB  - Searching for superconductivity with Tc near room temperature is of great
      interest both for fundamental science & many potential applications. Here we
      report the experimental discovery of superconductivity with maximum critical
      temperature (Tc) above 210 K in calcium superhydrides, the new alkali earth
      hydrides experimentally showing superconductivity above 200 K in addition to
      sulfur hydride & rare-earth hydride system. The materials are synthesized at the 
      synergetic conditions of 160~190 GPa and ~2000 K using diamond anvil cell
      combined with in-situ laser heating technique. The superconductivity was studied 
      through in-situ high pressure electric conductance measurements in an applied
      magnetic field for the sample quenched from high temperature while maintained at 
      high pressures. The upper critical field Hc(0) was estimated to be ~268 T while
      the GL coherent length is ~11 A. The in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction
      measurements suggest that the synthesized calcium hydrides are primarily composed
      of CaH6 while there may also exist other calcium hydrides with different hydrogen
      contents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of nutritional supplements to treat hypercholesterolemia is
      gradually increasing, however further studies on their efficacy and safety are
      required. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present clinical trial included patients with
      moderate hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk who were treated either
      with a nutraceutical preparation containing 3.75mg of monacolin K, 515mg of
      berberine and 50mg of coenzyme Q10 per tablet (Lipok(R)) or with a placebo. The
      clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed at baseline and at three and six 
      months. None of the patients was diabetic, and none was being treated with
      lipid-lowering drugs or with any other nutritional supplements affecting lipid
      metabolism. RESULTS: In patients of the intervention group and of the placebo
      group, baseline LDL-C was 134.7mg/dL (14.4) and 138.7mg/dL (15.2), respectively. 
      At three months after treatment start, LDL-C had decreased by 26.1mg/dL (-32.4 to
      19.7) and increased by 4.5mg/dL (-1.5 to 10.5) in the respective groups. In the
      intervention group, a similar decrease in non-HDL-C and total cholesterol was
      observed, while no significant changes were observed in either group for HDL-C,
      triglycerides and lipoprotein(a). A good tolerance and safety profile was
      observed. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the combination
      of monacolin K, berberine and coenzyme Q10 is effective and safe for treating
      hypercholesterolemia in patients with a moderate degree of excess LDL-C and
      cardiovascular risk.

AB  - This paper focuses on the problem of stability analysis for Riemann-Liouville
      nabla fractional order systems. On one hand, a useful comparison principle is
      built and then a rigorous proof is constructed for the well-known Lyapunov
      stability criterion in terms of class K functions. On the other hand, the
      constraint of the Lyapunov function is refined using a positive constant gamma4
      or a sequence h(k), resulting two practical theorems. Finally, three illustrative
      examples are given to show the applicability of the proposed method.

TI  - Role of Voltage-Gated K(+) Channels and K2P Channels in Intrinsic
      Electrophysiological Properties and Saltatory Conduction at Nodes of Ranvier of
      Rat Lumbar Spinal Ventral Nerves.
PG  - 4980-4994
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0514-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - Ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) are believed to play essential roles
      in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction of action
      potentials (AP) at the NRs of myelinated nerves. While we have recently shown
      that two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a key role at the NRs of
      Abeta-afferent nerves, K(+) channels and their functions at the NRs of mammalian 
      motor nerves remain elusive. Here we addressed this issue by using ex vivo
      preparations of lumbar spinal ventral nerves from both male and female rats and
      the pressure-patch-clamp recordings at their NRs. We found that depolarizing
      voltages evoked large noninactivating outward currents at NRs. The outward
      currents could be partially inhibited by voltage-gated K(+) channel blockers,
      largely inhibited by K2P blockers and cooling temperatures. Inhibition of the
      outward currents by voltage-gated K(+) channel blockers, K2P blockers, or cooling
      temperatures significantly altered electrophysiological properties measured at
      the NRs, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP width, AP
      amplitude, AP threshold, and AP rheobase. Furthermore, K2P blockers and cooling
      temperatures significantly reduced saltatory conduction velocity and success
      rates of APs in response to high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K(+)
      channel blockers reduced AP success rates at high-frequency stimulation without
      significantly affecting saltatory conduction velocity. Collectively, both K2P and
      voltage-gated K(+) channels play significant roles in intrinsic
      electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve
      fibers of rats. The effects of cooling temperatures on saltatory conduction are
      at least partially mediated by K2P channels at the NRs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ion
      channels localized at the NRs are believed to be key determinants of saltatory
      conduction on myelinated nerves. However, ion channels and their functions at the
      NRs have not been fully studied in different types of mammalian myelinated
      nerves. Here we use the pressure-patch-clamp recordings to show that both K2P and
      voltage-gated K(+) channels play significant roles in intrinsic
      electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of lumbar spinal 
      ventral nerves of rats. Furthermore, cooling temperatures exert effects on
      saltatory conduction via inhibition of ion channels at the NRs. Our results
      provide new insights into saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves and may have 
      physiological as well as pathologic implications.

PG  - e2201644119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2201644119 [doi]
AB  - Spatial resolution in MRI is ultimately limited by the signal detection
      sensitivity of NMR, since resolution equal to rhoiso in all three dimensions
      requires the detection of NMR signals from a volume rhoiso3. With inductively
      detected NMR at room temperature, it has therefore proven difficult to achieve
      isotropic resolution better than rhoiso = 3.0 mum, even with radio-frequency
      microcoils, optimized samples, high magnetic fields, optimized pulse sequence
      methods, and data acquisition times around 60 h. Here we show that spatial
      resolution can be improved and data acquisition times can be reduced
      substantially by performing MRI measurements at 5 K and using dynamic nuclear
      polarization (DNP) to enhance sensitivity. We describe the experimental apparatus
      and methods, and we report images of test samples with rhoiso = 2.6 mum and
      rhoiso = 1.7 mum, with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 15, acquired in 31.5
      and 81.6 h, respectively. Image resolutions are verified by quantitative
      comparisons with simulations. These results establish a promising direction for
      high-resolution MRI of small samples. With further improvements in the
      experimental apparatus and in paramagnetic dopants for DNP, DNP-enhanced
      low-temperature MRI with rhoiso < 1.0 mum is likely to become feasible,
      potentially enabling informative studies of structures within typical eukaryotic 
      cells, cell clusters, and tissue samples.

PG  - 1361-1373
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3176575 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in the usage of consumer based EEG
      devices with fewer channel configuration. Although independent component analysis
      has been a popular approach for eye-blink artifact removal from multichannel EEG 
      signals, several studies showed that there is a leak of neural information into
      the eye-blink artifact associated independent components (ICs). Furthermore, the 
      leak increases as the number of input EEG channels decreases and leads to loss of
      valuable EEG information. To overcome this problem, we developed a new framework 
      that combines ICA with continuous wavelet transform (CWT), k- means and singular 
      spectrum analysis (SSA) methods. In contrast to the existing approaches, the
      artifact region in the identified eye-blink artifact IC is detected and
      suppressed rather than setting it to zero as in classical ICA. As most of the
      energy in the eye-blink artifact IC is concentrated in the artifact region, CWT
      and k- means algorithms exploits this feature to detect the eye-blink artifact
      region. Support vector machine (SVM) based classifier is finally designed for
      automatic detection of the eye blink artifact ICs. The performance of proposed
      method is evaluated on synthetic and two real EEG datasets for various EEG
      channels setting. Results highlight that for fewer channel EEG signals, the
      proposed method provides accurate separation without any neural information loss 
      as compared to the existing methods.

TI  - Anatomical and Biochemical Evolutionary Ancient Traits of Araucaria araucana
      (Molina) K. Koch and Their Effects on Carbon Assimilation.
LID - tpac057 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpac057 [doi]
AB  - The study of ancient species provides valuable information concerning the
      evolution of specific adaptations to past and current environmental conditions.
      Araucaria araucana belongs to one of the oldest families of conifers in the
      world, despite this, there are few studies focused on its physiology and
      responses to changes in environmental conditions. We used an integrated approach 
      aimed at comprehensively characterizing the ecophysiology of this poorly known
      species, focusing in its stomatal, mesophyll, and biochemical traits,
      hypothesizing that these traits govern the carbon assimilation of A. araucana
      under past and present levels of atmospheric CO2. Results indicated that A.
      araucana presents the typical traits of an ancient species, such as large stomata
      and low stomatal density, which trigger low stomatal conductance and slow
      stomatal responsiveness to changing environmental conditions. Interestingly, the 
      quantitative analysis showed that photosynthetic rates were equally limited by
      both diffusive and biochemical components. The Rubisco catalytic properties
      proved to have a low Rubisco affinity for CO2 and O2, similar to other ancient
      species. This affinity for CO2, together with the slow carboxylation turnover
      rate, are responsible for the low Rubisco catalytic efficiency of carboxylation. 
      These traits could be the result of the diverse environmental selective pressures
      that A. araucana was exposed during its diversification. The increase in measured
      temperatures induced an increase in stomatal and biochemical limitations, which
      together with a lower Rubisco affinity for CO2 could explain the low
      photosynthetic capacity of A. araucana in warmer conditions.

TI  - Receptor-like protein kinase BAK1 promotes K+ uptake by regulating H+-ATPase AHA2
      under low potassium stress.
PG  - 2227-2243
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiac237 [doi]
AB  - Potassium (K+) is one of the essential macronutrients for plant growth and
      development. However, the available K+ concentration in soil is relatively low.
      Plant roots can perceive low K+ (LK) stress, then enhance high-affinity K+ uptake
      by activating H+-ATPases in root cells, but the mechanisms are still unclear.
      Here, we identified the receptor-like protein kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive 
      1-Associated Receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1) that is involved in LK response by
      regulating the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plasma membrane H+-ATPase
      isoform 2 (AHA2). The bak1 mutant showed leaf chlorosis phenotype and reduced K+ 
      content under LK conditions, which was due to the decline of K+ uptake capacity. 
      BAK1 could directly interact with the AHA2 C terminus and phosphorylate T858 and 
      T881, by which the H+ pump activity of AHA2 was enhanced. The bak1 aha2 double
      mutant also displayed a leaf chlorosis phenotype that was similar to their single
      mutants. The constitutively activated form AHA2Delta98 and phosphorylation-mimic 
      form AHA2T858D or AHA2T881D could complement the LK sensitive phenotypes of both 
      aha2 and bak1 mutants. Together, our data demonstrate that BAK1 phosphorylates
      AHA2 and enhances its activity, which subsequently promotes K+ uptake under LK
      conditions.

TI  - kngMap: Sensitive and Fast Mapping Algorithm for Noisy Long Reads Based on the
      K-Mer Neighborhood Graph.
PG  - 890651
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.890651 [doi]
AB  - With the rapid development of single molecular sequencing (SMS) technologies such
      as PacBio single-molecule real-time and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, the output
      read length is continuously increasing, which has dramatical potentials on
      cutting-edge genomic applications. Mapping these reads to a reference genome is
      often the most fundamental and computing-intensive step for downstream analysis. 
      However, these long reads contain higher sequencing errors and could more
      frequently span the breakpoints of structural variants (SVs) than those of
      shorter reads, leading to many unaligned reads or reads that are partially
      aligned for most state-of-the-art mappers. As a result, these methods usually
      focus on producing local mapping results for the query read rather than obtaining
      the whole end-to-end alignment. We introduce kngMap, a novel k-mer neighborhood
      graph-based mapper that is specifically designed to align long noisy SMS reads to
      a reference sequence. By benchmarking exhaustive experiments on both simulated
      and real-life SMS datasets to assess the performance of kngMap with ten other
      popular SMS mapping tools (e.g., BLASR, BWA-MEM, and minimap2), we demonstrated
      that kngMap has higher sensitivity that can align more reads and bases to the
      reference genome; meanwhile, kngMap can produce consecutive alignments for the
      whole read and span different categories of SVs in the reads. kngMap is
      implemented in C++ and supports multi-threading; the source code of kngMap can be
      downloaded for free at: https://github.com/zhang134/kngMap for academic usage.

TI  - Compound K ameliorates airway inflammation and mucus secretion through the
      regulation of PKC signaling in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 496-504
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2021.12.008 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cigarette smoke (CS) is considered a principal cause of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with mucus hypersecretion 
      and airway inflammation. Ginsenoside compound K (CK), a product of ginsenoside
      metabolism, has various biological activities. Studies on the effects of CK for
      the treatment of COPD and mucus hypersecretion, including the underlying
      signaling mechanism, have not yet been conducted. Methods: To study the
      protective effects and molecular mechanism of CK, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
      (PMA)-induced human airway epithelial (NCI-H292) cells were used as a cellular
      model of airway inflammation. An experimental mouse COPD model was also
      established via CS inhalation and intranasal administration of
      lipopolysaccharide. Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 secretion, as well as
      elastase activity and reactive oxygen species production, were determined through
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inflammatory cell influx and mucus secretion
      in mouse lung tissues were estimated using hematoxylin and eosin and periodic
      acid-schiff staining, respectively. PKCdelta and its downstream signaling
      molecules were analyzed via western blotting. Results: CK prevented the secretion
      of MUC5AC and TNF-alpha in PMA-stimulated NCI-H292 cells and exhibited a
      protective effect in COPD mice via the suppression of inflammatory mediators and 
      mucus secretion. These effects were accompanied by an inactivation of PKCdelta
      and related signaling in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: CK suppressed pulmonary
      inflammation and mucus secretion in COPD mouse model through PKC regulation,
      highlighting the compound's potential as a useful adjuvant in the prevention and 
      treatment of COPD.

TI  - Ginsenoside compound K ameliorates palmitate-induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes
      via promyogenic effects and AMPK/autophagy-mediated suppression of endoplasmic
      reticulum stress.
PG  - 444-453
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2021.09.002 [doi]
AB  - Background: Compound K (CK) is among the protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenoside
      group, which produces multiple pharmacological effects. Herein, we examined the
      effects of CK on muscle atrophy under hyperlipidemic conditions along with its
      pro-myogenic effects. Further, the molecular pathways underlying the effects of
      CK on skeletal muscle have been justified. Methods: C2C12 myotubes were treated
      with palmitate and CK. C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated using CK for 4-5 days.
      For the in vivo experiments, CK was administered to mice fed on a high-fat diet
      for 8 weeks. The protein expression levels were analyzed using western blotting
      analysis. Target protein suppression was performed using small interfering (si)
      RNA transfection. Histological examination was performed using Jenner-Giemsa and 
      H&E staining techniques. Results: CK treatment attenuated ER stress markers, such
      as eIF2alpha phosphorylation and CHOP expression and impaired myotube formation
      in palmitate-treated C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscle of mice fed on HFD. CK
      treatment augmented AMPK along with autophagy markers in skeletal muscle cells in
      vitro and in vivo experiments. AMPK siRNA or 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor,
      abrogated the impacts of CK in C2C12 myotubes. CK treatment augmented p38 and Akt
      phosphorylation, leading to an enhancement of C2C12 myogenesis. However, AMPK
      siRNA abolished the effects of CK in C2C12 myoblasts. Conclusion: These findings 
      denote that CK prevents lipid-induced skeletal muscle apoptosis via
      AMPK/autophagy-mediated attenuation of ER stress and induction of myoblast
      differentiation. Therefore, we may suggest the use of CK as a potential
      therapeutic approach for treating muscle-wasting conditions associated with
      obesity.

AB  - The ERG1 potassium channel, encoded by KCNH2, has long been associated with
      cardiac electrical excitability. Yet, a growing body of work suggests that ERG1
      mediates physiology throughout the human body, including the brain. ERG1 is a
      regulator of neuronal excitability, ERG1 variants are associated with neuronal
      diseases (e.g., epilepsy and schizophrenia), and ERG1 serves as a potential
      therapeutic target for neuronal pathophysiology. This review summarizes the
      current state-of-the-field regarding the ERG1 channel structure and function,
      ERG1's relationship to the mammalian brain and highlights key questions that have
      yet to be answered.

TI  - Effects of methylphenidate after a long period of discontinuation include changes
      in exploratory behavior and increases brain activities of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and
      acetylcholinesterase.

AB  - Methylphenidate (MPH) has been widely misused by children and adolescents who do 
      not meet all diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
      Since it is not yet known whether MPH can be administered in childhood without
      consequences in adulthood, in the present study we proposed to investigate the
      effects of chronic early treatment with MPH after a long period of
      discontinuation. Wistar male rats were injected with MPH (2 mg/kg,
      intraperitoneally) or saline solution once daily from 15th to 44th day of life.
      Two months after the last MPH administration, we evaluated the animal's
      performances on a battery of behavior tests. We also tested Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and
      acetylcholinesterase activities in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which may
      be associated with behavior. Rats treated with MPH during peri-adolescence show
      changes in exploratory behavior in adulthood in the open field but not in the
      elevated plus maze and light-dark transition tests. MPH-treated rats showed a
      lower latency to find the platform in the training phase, as well as a better
      performance in the test phase in the Morris water maze test. No differences were 
      observed in the object recognition index and working memory. Acetylcholinesterase
      was increased in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, while Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was
      increased only in hippocampus. These findings provide additional evidence that
      early-life exposure to MPH can have complex effects in adulthood and new basis
      for understanding the behavioral and neurochemical consequences associated with
      chronic use of MPH during the development of central nervous system.

AB  - In order to acquire both expanded binding ability with the EphA2 receptor and
      superior drug delivery capacity, we designed and synthesized the modified
      GO-SWL-Ahx-K-SWL conjugate as a potential targeted therapeutic drug for non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Various characterization methods have confirmed that
      the conjugate is consistent with the theoretical peptide. The cytotoxicity test
      results showed that the conjugate was slightly more toxic to A549 cells than in 3
      T3 cells, and the toxicity increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Single 
      photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion imaging
      was performed to evaluate the conjugate binding to EphA2 receptor in vivo. The
      images showed obvious radioactive concentration in tumor tissues and
      significantly higher ratios of the tumor and muscle in the
      (125)I-GO-SWL-Ahx-K-SWL group (10.78) than in the (125)I-SWL-Ahx-K-SWL group
      (5.21) at all three time points (P < 0.01).

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities for Improved Drug-Drug Interaction Predictions for
      Renal OCT2 and MATE1/2-K Transporters.
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2666 [doi]
AB  - Transporters contribute to renal elimination of drugs; therefore drug disposition
      can be impacted if transporters are inhibited by comedicant drugs. Regulatory
      agencies have provided guidelines to assess potential drug-drug interaction (DDI)
      risk for renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin
      extrusion 1 and 2-K (MATE1/2-K) transporters. Despite this, there are challenges 
      with translating in vitro data using currently available tools to obtain a
      quantitative assessment of DDI risk in the clinic. Given the high number of drugs
      and new molecular entities showing in vitro inhibition toward OCT2 and/or
      MATE1/2-K and the lack of translation to clinically significant effects, it is
      reasonable to question whether the current in vitro assay design and modeling
      practice has led to unnecessary clinical evaluation. The aim of this review is to
      assess and discuss available in vitro and clinical data along with prediction
      models intended to provide clinical context of risk, including static models
      proposed by regulatory agencies and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models,
      in order to identify best practices and areas of future opportunity. This
      analysis highlights that different in vitro assay designs, including substrate
      and cell systems used, strongly influence the derived concentration of drug
      producing 50% inhibition values and contribute to high variability observed
      across laboratories. Furthermore, the lack of sensitive index substrates coupled 
      with specific inhibitors for individual transporters necessitates the use of
      complex models to evaluate clinical DDI risk.

AB  - We report pure-rotational N2-N2, N2-air, and O2-air S-branch linewidths for
      temperatures of 80-200 K by measuring the time-dependent decay of rotational
      Raman coherences in an isentropic free-jet expansion from a sonic nozzle. We
      recorded pure-rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman
      scattering (fs/ps CARS) spectra along the axial centerline of the underexpanded
      jet, within the barrel shock region upstream of the Mach disk. The dephasing of
      the pure-rotational Raman coherence was monitored using probe-time-delay scans at
      different axial positions in the jet, corresponding to varying local temperatures
      and pressures. The local temperature was obtained by fitting CARS spectra
      acquired at zero probe time delay, where the impact of collisions was minimal.
      The measured decay of each available Raman transition was fit to a dephasing
      constant and corrected for the local pressure, which was obtained from the
      CARS-measured static temperature and thermodynamic relationships for isentropic
      expansion from the known stagnation state. Nitrogen self-broadened transitions
      decayed more rapidly than those broadened in air for all temperatures,
      corresponding to higher Raman linewidths. In general, the measured S-branch
      linewidths deviated significantly in absolute and relative magnitudes from those 
      predicted by extrapolating the modified exponential gap model to low
      temperatures. The temperature dependence of the Raman linewidth for each measured
      rotational state of nitrogen (J </= 10) and oxygen (N </= 11) was fit to a
      temperature-dependent power law over the measurable temperature domain (80-200 K)
      and extrapolated to both higher rotational states and room temperature. The
      measured and modeled low-temperature linewidth data provided here will aid low
      temperature gas-phase pressure measurements with fs/ps CARS.

TI  - HSc70 interactome reveal major role of macroautophagy and minor role of chaperone
      mediated autophagy in K-Ras G12V cell proliferation and survival.

AB  - Constitutively active K-Ras oncogene mutation at G12V changes the proteome of
      cells and activates macroautophagy for cell advantage. Inhibition of
      macroautophagy impairs K-Ras mediated tumor progression to a limited extent with 
      increase of spontaneous tumors due to poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show
      that inhibition of macroautophagy in K-Ras G12V mouse embryonic fibroblasts
      (MEFs) hyper activates chaperon mediated autophagy (CMA). Quantitative
      identification of CMA substrates through co-immunoprecipitation of CMA component 
      heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) demonstrates a shift of proteins from
      macroautophagy to CMA mediated degradation. However, macroautophagy impairment
      show significant inhibition on proliferation and CMA hyper activation provides a 
      basal support to macroautophagy-inhibited MEFs for survival. On the other hand,
      K-Ras G12V MEFs impaired of CMA reduces number of Hsc70 clients but activated
      macroautophagy significantly compensated CMA loss. Nonetheless, co-inhibition of 
      CMA and macroautophagy had a synergistic detrimental effect on both proliferation
      and survival of MEFs expressing K-Ras G12V mutant. Our results point to K-Ras
      G12V MEFs dependency on macroautophagy and CMA partly compensates its loss for
      survival but not hyper-proliferation; implicating that targeting both
      macroautophagy and CMA as a promising therapeutic target in G12V mutation
      associated K-Ras cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provides a framework of
      Hsc70 interacting proteins, which differentially interact with Hsc70 in response 
      to autophagy alterations. The role of proteins accumulation and induced
      proteo-toxicity could be underlying factor in macroautophagy and CMA co-inhibited
      K-Ras G12V MEFs phenotype. Our study provides rational for adaptive mechanisms in
      K-Ras tumors inhibited with different autophagy pathways and also supports
      targeting both macroautophagy and CMA simultaneously as therapeutic target. At
      the same time current study will help in characterizing the underlying cellular
      processes that may play a role in escaping tutor suppressor role CMA and
      macroautophagy in cancers harboring K-Ras G12V mutation that may be further
      utilized to identify molecular targets for K-Ras-driven cancers.

TI  - Pressure-Induced Superconductivity up to 9 K in the Quasi-One-Dimensional
      KMn_{6}Bi_{5}.
PG  - 187001
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.187001 [doi]
AB  - The Mn-based superconductor is rare owing to the strong magnetic pair-breaking
      effect. Here we report on the discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in 
      KMn_{6}Bi_{5}, which becomes the first ternary Mn-based superconductor. At
      ambient pressure, the quasi-one-dimensional KMn_{6}Bi_{5} is an antiferromagnetic
      metal with T_{N} approximately 75 K. By measuring resistance and ac magnetic
      susceptibility under hydrostatic pressures up to 14.2 GPa in a cubic anvil cell
      apparatus, we find that its antiferromagnetic transition can be suppressed
      completely at a critical pressure of P_{c} approximately 13 GPa, around which
      bulk superconductivity emerges and displays a superconducting dome with the
      maximal T_{c}^{onset}=9.3 K achieved at about 14 GPa. The close proximity of
      superconductivity to a magnetic instability in the temperature-pressure phase
      diagram of KMn_{6}Bi_{5} and an unusually large mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) exceeding the
      Pauli paramagnetic limit suggests an unconventional magnetism-mediated paring
      mechanism. In contrast to the binary MnP, the flexibility of the crystal
      structure and chemical compositions in the ternary AMn_{6}Bi_{5} (A=alkali metal)
      can open a new avenue for finding more Mn-based superconductors.

      sodium alginate and K-Car. The molecular weight distribution and secondary
      structure of the conjugates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier transform
      infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The storage stability of the emulsion stabilized by
      conjugates was measured with Turbiscan stability index (TSI) and fluctuation of
      the particle size. The TSI value of ternary conjugates was 18.7 (37) with
      particle sizes ranging from 208 to 319 nm. Then, the changes of three-dimensional
      reticulate structures and physical properties of sodium alginate-K were analyzed 
      by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TPA. The thermal stability of the
      sodium alginate-K-Car composite systems was increased compared with sodium
      alginate. The bioaccessibility of lycopene was significantly improved under the
      dual embedding of BSA-DEX-GA conjugate emulsion and sodium alginate-K-Car
      composite systems.

LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.860111 [doi]
AB  - To identify the key indicators for salt tolerance evaluation of Salix matsudana
      Koidz, we explored the relationship of ion absorption and distribution with
      chlorophyll, fluorescence parameters (leaf performance index, maximum
      photochemical efficiency), and photosynthetic gas parameters (net photosynthetic 
      rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, intercellular carbon dioxide
      concentration) under salt stress. We established 4 treatment groups and one
      control group based on salinity levels of NaCl hydroponic solutions (171, 342,
      513, and 684 mm). The Na(+)/K(+), Na(+)/Ca(2+), chlorophyll fluorescence, and
      photosynthetic parameters of leaves were measured on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th,
      11th, and 15th days to analyze the correlations of chlorophyll, chlorophyll
      fluorescence and photosynthetic parameters to the ion distribution ratio. The
      results showed that (1) The ratio of the dry weight of roots to leaves gradually 
      increased with increasing salt concentration, whereas the water content of leaves
      and roots first increased and then decreased with increasing time. (2) The
      content of Na(+), Na(+/)K(+), and Na(+)/Ca(2+) in roots and leaves increased with
      increasing salt stress concentration and treatment time, and the difference
      gradually narrowed. (3) Ca(2+) was lost more than K(+) under salt stress, and
      Na(+)/Ca(2+) was more sensitive to the salt stress environment than Na(+)/K(+).
      (4) Because the root system had a retention effect, both Na(+)/K(+) and
      Na(+)/Ca(2+) in roots under different NaCl concentrations and different treatment
      times were higher than those in leaves, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) was much higher than
      Na(+)/K(+) in roots. (5) Na(+/)K(+) had a higher correlation with fluorescence
      parameters than Na(+)/Ca(2+). Among them, Na(+)/K(+) had a significantly negative
      correlation with the maximum photochemical efficiency, and the correlation
      coefficient R (2) was 0.8576. (6) Photosynthetic gas parameters had a higher
      correlation with Na(+)/Ca(2+) than with Na(+)/K(+). Among them, significantly
      negative correlations were noted between Na(+)/Ca(2+) and Gs as well as between
      Na(+)/Ca(2+) and E under salt stress. The correlation between Na(+)/Ca(2+) and Gs
      was the highest with a correlation coefficient of 0.9368. (7) Na(+)/K(+) and
      Na(+)/Ca(2+) had no significant correlation with chlorophylls. Na(+)/Ca(2+) was
      selected as a key index to evaluate the salt tolerance of S. matsudana Koidz, and
      the results provided a reference for analyzing the relationship between ion
      transport and distribution for photosynthesis.

TI  - A Low-Profile SIW-Based CTS Array with Reconfigurable Four Beams and Dual
      Polarizations for K-Band Sensing.
LID - 3563 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22093563 [doi]
AB  - A dual-polarized continuous transverse stub (CTS) K-band antenna with
      reconfigurable four beams and low profile is proposed based on
      substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) design. It consists of a line source
      generator (LSG) on the bottom surface, a spherical-wave to plane-wave
      transforming part on the middle layer, and CTS radiators on the top surface.
      Particularly, the LSG has four SIW-based H-plane horns, and a chip is integrated 
      to switch among the two pairs of horns, so as to transfer the quasi-TEM waves on 
      the bottom surface by a +/-10 degrees deflection angle to the middle layer for
      the CTS radiators on the top surface, resulting in four reconfigurable scanning
      beams with 10 degrees for two polarizations. The measurements show that it
      realizes four reconfigurable beams with a 25.8 dBi gain at 24 GHz, verifying the 
      design. The proposed antenna takes into account the advantages of reconfigurable 
      multi-beam, dual polarization, low side lobes, low profile, and high gain, which 
      can be applied to K-band sensing, especially for wind profile radars.

AB  - To improve the performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a hotly
      researched metal-free photocatalyst, for better application in the efficient
      removal of organic pollutants, adsorption synergistically enhanced photocatalysis
      mechanism was thoroughly explored. Based on KOH pore-forming activated biochar
      (ACB) and K(+) doped g-C3N4 (K-gC3N4), the novel activated biochar-based K-gC3N4 
      composite (ACB-K-gC3N4) was synthesized via the innovative ultrasonic-milling
      method. Rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR), and
      chloramphenicol (CAP) were selected as target pollutants, and the effects of
      environmental factors, recycling and actual wastewater tests, disinfection
      effects, and various enhancement strategies were investigated. The results showed
      that K-gC3N4 was successfully composited with ACB by various characterizations,
      where the loading mass ratio of 1:2 exhibited the best performance. ACB-K-gC3N4
      possessed a larger specific surface area, richer functional groups, suitable band
      gap (2.29 eV), and broader visible light absorption (~716 nm) than K-gC3N4.
      ACB-K-gC3N4 presented effective removal efficiency over K-gC3N4 for four
      pollutants, in which the removal efficiency of RhB reached 93.26%, and the
      degradation rate constant of 0.0119 min(-1) was four times higher than K-gC3N4
      (0.0029 min(-1)). Moreover, ACB-K-gC3N4 was superior to K-gC3N4 in disinfecting
      S. aureus and E. coli, with a sterilization rate of exceeding 90% for 12 h. The
      photodegradation activity was dominated by .O2(-), h(+), and .OH, and the
      mechanisms involved in the three stages. This was attributed to the unique
      structure and surface properties (defects and persistent free radicals) of ACB,
      as evidenced by improved adsorption stage and transfer of degradation
      intermediates, facilitated the generation of active species, accelerated
      migration of photogenerated electrons, and inhibited photogenerated carriers
      recombination by the heterojunction. The good reusability and stability,
      enhancement strategies (blowing air and heating), and satisfactory feasibility
      for actual wastewater allow ACB-K-gC3N4 possible to promote high-concentration
      wastewater treatment and disinfection.

AB  - Loss- or gain-of-function mutations in ATP-sensitive potassium channel
      (K-ATP)-encoding genes, KCNJ8 and ABCC9, cause human central nervous system
      disorders with unknown pathogenesis. Here, using mice, zebrafish, and cell
      culture models, we investigated cellular and molecular causes of brain
      dysfunctions derived from altered K-ATP channel function. We show that
      genetic/chemical inhibition or activation of KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channel
      function leads to brain-selective suppression or promotion of arterial/arteriolar
      vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation, respectively. We further show
      that brain VSMCs develop from KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channel-expressing
      mural cell progenitor and that K-ATP channel cell autonomously regulates VSMC
      differentiation through modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) oscillation via
      voltage-dependent calcium channels. Consistent with defective VSMC development,
      Kcnj8 knockout mice showed deficiency in vasoconstrictive capacity and
      neuronal-evoked vasodilation leading to local hyperemia. Our results demonstrate 
      a role for KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channels in the differentiation of brain 
      VSMC, which in turn is necessary for fine-tuning of cerebral blood flow.

TI  - Tri-Branch Convolutional Neural Networks for Top-k Focused Academic Performance
      Prediction.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3175068 [doi]
AB  - Academic performance prediction aims to leverage student-related information to
      predict their future academic outcomes, which is beneficial to numerous
      educational applications, such as personalized teaching and academic early
      warning. In this article, we reveal the students' behavior trajectories by mining
      campus smartcard records, and capture the characteristics inherent in
      trajectories for academic performance prediction. Particularly, we carefully
      design a tri-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is
      equipped with rowwise, columnwise, and depthwise convolutions and attention
      operations, to effectively capture the persistence, regularity, and temporal
      distribution of student behavior in an end-to-end manner, respectively. However, 
      different from existing works mainly targeting at improving the prediction
      performance for the whole students, we propose to cast academic performance
      prediction as a top-k ranking problem, and introduce a top-k focused loss to
      ensure the accuracy of identifying academically at-risk students. Extensive
      experiments were carried out on a large-scale real-world dataset, and we show
      that our approach substantially outperforms recently proposed methods for
      academic performance prediction. For the sake of reproducibility, our codes have 
      been released at https://github.com/ZongJ1111/Academic-Performance-Prediction.

TI  - Role of Ions in Hydrogels with an Ionic Seebeck Coefficient of 52.9 mV K(-1).
PG  - 4621-4627
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c00845 [doi]
AB  - Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) material with mobile ions as charge carriers has the 
      potential to generate large thermal voltages at low operating temperatures. This 
      study highlights the role of ions in i-TE hydrogels employing a poly(vinyl
      alcohol) (PVA) polymer matrix and a number of ion providers, e.g., KOH, KNO3,
      KCl, KBr, NaI, KI, and CsI. The relationship between the intrinsic physical
      parameters of the ion and the thermoelectric performance is established,
      indicating the ability to influence the hydrogen bond by the ion is a crucial
      factor. Among these i-TE hydrogels, the PVA/CsI hydrogel exhibits the largest
      ionic Seebeck coefficient, reaching 52.9 mV K(-1), which is the largest of all
      i-TE materials reported to date. In addition, our work demonstrates the influence
      of ions on polymer configuration and provides an avenue for ion selection in the 
      Soret effect in ionic thermoelectrics.

TI  - Cisplatin Neurotoxicity Targets Specific Subpopulations and K(+) Channels in
      Tyrosine-Hydroxylase Positive Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons.
PG  - 853035
LID - 10.3389/fncel.2022.853035 [doi]
AB  - Among the features of cisplatin chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are
      chronic pain and innocuous mechanical hypersensitivity. The complete etiology of 
      the latter remains unknown. Here, we show that cisplatin targets a heterogeneous 
      population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) primary afferent dorsal root 
      ganglion neurons (DRGNs) in mice, determined using single-cell transcriptome and 
      electrophysiological analyses. TH(+) DRGNs regulate innocuous mechanical
      sensation through C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. A differential assessment of 
      wild-type and vitamin E deficient TH(+) DRGNs revealed heterogeneity and specific
      functional phenotypes. The TH(+) DRGNs comprise; fast-adapting eliciting one
      action potential (AP; 1-AP), moderately-adapting (>/=2-APs), in responses to
      square-pulse current injection, and spontaneously active (SA). Cisplatin
      increased the input resistance and AP frequency but reduced the temporal coding
      feature of 1-AP and >/=2-APs neurons. By contrast, cisplatin has no measurable
      effect on the SA neurons. Vitamin E reduced the cisplatin-mediated increased
      excitability but did not improve the TH(+) neuron temporal coding properties.
      Cisplatin mediates its effect by targeting outward K(+) current, likely carried
      through K2P18.1 (Kcnk18), discovered through the differential transcriptome
      studies and heterologous expression. Studies show a potential new cellular target
      for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and implicate the possible
      neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in cisplatin chemotherapy.

      regulatory framework.

AB  - We open an avenue for discussing how we can pave the way for compliance with
      existing regulations is a far-reaching factor for settling nuclear fusion
      technology. Based on a model of the Korean Fusion Demonstration Reactor (K-DEMO) 
      with a target fusion power of 2.2 GW, we assess the intrinsic safety determinants
      of internal energy sources, the expected radioactive waste, and the tritium
      management. Regarding these safety factors, we scrutinize the compatibility of
      the current legislative environment in Korea with K-DEMO and envisage foreseeable
      obstacles, such as licensing of the nuclear facilities and acceptability of the
      radioactive waste. Based on precedent licenses for the Korean Superconducting
      Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) and lessons learned from the International
      Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), we examine hazardous factors that
      would threaten regulatory compliance of K-DEMO. This approach can help shape a
      fusion-compatible framework for consolidating the necessary technical provisions 
      and regulatory baselines reflecting social acceptance with a sense of safety.
      Fusion-compatible aspects in the regulatory environment are discussed, from
      fusion philosophy to subordinate administrative and technical guidelines,
      facility classification, and detailed methods guaranteeing integrity and safety. 
      This paper will contribute to the timely settlement of fusion demonstration
      facilities and subsequent commercial plants.

AB  - Cathepsin K inhibitor (odanacatib; ODN) and cathepsin K knockdown (siRNA) enhance
      oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis through p53-dependent Bax upregulation. However,
      its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we elucidated the
      mechanism behind enhancement of oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis by ODN. We also
      investigated the molecular mechanisms of ODN-induced Bax upregulation. Here, we
      demonstrated that ODN-induced Bax upregulation required p53, but it was
      independent of p53 transcriptional activity. Various mutants of the DNA-binding
      domain of p53 induced Bax upregulation in ODN-treated cells. p53 functional
      domain analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of p53 participates in the
      physical interaction and stabilization of Sp1, a major transcription factor of
      Bax. We screened a specific siRNA encoding 50 deubiquitinases and identified that
      BAP1 stabilizes Sp1. The knockdown or catalytic mutant form of BAP1 abolished the
      ODN-induced upregulation of Sp1 and Bax expression. Mechanistically, ODN induced 
      BAP1 phosphorylation and enhanced Sp1-BAP1 interaction, resulting in Sp1
      ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, ODN-induced BAP1 phosphorylation
      and DNA damage were modulated by the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS). Mitochondrial ROS scavengers prevented DNA damage, BAP1-mediated
      Sp1 stabilization, and Bax upregulation by ODN. BAP1 downregulation by siRNA
      inhibited apoptosis induced by the combined treatment of ODN and
      oxaliplatin/etoposide. Therefore, Sp1 is a crucial transcription factor for
      ODN-induced Bax upregulation, and Sp1 stabilization is regulated by BAP1.

TI  - Kir7.1 disease mutant T153I within the inner pore affects K(+) conduction.
PG  - C56-C68
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00093.2022 [doi]
AB  - Inward-rectifier potassium channel 7.1 (Kir7.1) is present in the polarized
      epithelium, including the retinal pigmented epithelium. A single amino acid
      change at position 153 in the KCNJ13 gene, a substitution of threonine to
      isoleucine in the Kir7.1 protein, causes blindness. We hypothesized that the
      disease caused by this single amino acid substitution within the transmembrane
      protein domain could alter the translation, localization, or ion transport
      properties. We assessed the effects of amino acid side-chain length, arrangement,
      and polarity on channel structure and function. We showed that the T153I mutation
      yielded a full-length protein localized to the cell membrane. Whole cell
      patch-clamp recordings and chord conductance analyses revealed that the T153I
      mutant channel had negligible K(+) conductance and failed to hyperpolarize the
      membrane potential. However, the mutant channel exhibited enhanced inward current
      when rubidium was used as a charge carrier, suggesting that an inner pore had
      formed and the channel was dysfunctional. Substituting with a polar, nonpolar, or
      short side-chain amino acid did not affect the localization of the protein.
      Still, it had an altered channel function due to differences in pore radius.
      Polar side chains (cysteine and serine) with inner pore radii comparable to
      wildtype exhibited normal inward K(+) conductance. Short side chains (glycine and
      alanine) produced a channel with wider than expected inner pore size and lacked
      the biophysical characteristics of the wild-type channel. Leucine substitution
      produced results similar to the T153I mutant channel. This study provides direct 
      electrophysiological evidence for the structure and function of the Kir7.1
      channel's narrow inner pore in regulating conductance.

TI  - Locality-Sensitive Hashing-Based k-Mer Clustering for Identification of
      Differential Microbial Markers Related to Host Phenotype.
PG  - 738-751
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2021.0640 [doi]
AB  - Microbial organisms play important roles in many aspects of human health and
      diseases. Encouraged by the numerous studies that show the association between
      microbiomes and human diseases, computational and machine learning methods have
      been recently developed to generate and utilize microbiome features for
      prediction of host phenotypes such as disease versus healthy cancer immunotherapy
      responder versus nonresponder. We have previously developed a subtractive
      assembly approach, which focuses on extraction and assembly of differential reads
      from metagenomic data sets that are likely sampled from differential genomes or
      genes between two groups of microbiome data sets (e.g., healthy vs. disease). In 
      this article, we further improved our subtractive assembly approach by utilizing 
      groups of k-mers with similar abundance profiles across multiple samples. We
      implemented a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-enabled approach (called
      kmerLSHSA) to group billions of k-mers into k-mer coabundance groups (kCAGs),
      which were subsequently used for the retrieval of differential kCAGs for
      subtractive assembly. Testing of the kmerLSHSA approach on simulated data sets
      and real microbiome data sets showed that, compared with the conventional
      approach that utilizes all genes, our approach can quickly identify differential 
      genes that can be used for building promising predictive models for
      microbiome-based host phenotype prediction. We also discussed other potential
      applications of LSH-enabled clustering of k-mers according to their abundance
      profiles across multiple microbiome samples.

TI  - RegulonDB 11.0: Comprehensive high-throughput datasets on transcriptional
      regulation in Escherichia coli K-12.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000833 [doi]
AB  - Genomics has set the basis for a variety of methodologies that produce
      high-throughput datasets identifying the different players that define gene
      regulation, particularly regulation of transcription initiation and operon
      organization. These datasets are available in public repositories, such as the
      Gene Expression Omnibus, or ArrayExpress. However, accessing and navigating such 
      a wealth of data is not straightforward. No resource currently exists that offers
      all available high and low-throughput data on transcriptional regulation in
      Escherichia coli K-12 to easily use both as whole datasets, or as individual
      interactions and regulatory elements. RegulonDB (https://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx)
      began gathering high-throughput dataset collections in 2009, starting with
      transcription start sites, then adding ChIP-seq and gSELEX in 2012, with up to 99
      different experimental high-throughput datasets available in 2019. In this paper 
      we present a radical upgrade to more than 2000 high-throughput datasets,
      processed to facilitate their comparison, introducing up-to-date collections of
      transcription termination sites, transcription units, as well as transcription
      factor binding interactions derived from ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, gSELEX and DAP-seq
      experiments, besides expression profiles derived from RNA-seq experiments. For
      ChIP-seq experiments we offer both the data as presented by the authors, as well 
      as data uniformly processed in-house, enhancing their comparability, as well as
      the traceability of the methods and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, 
      we have expanded the tools available for browsing and visualization across and
      within datasets. We include comparisons against previously existing knowledge in 
      RegulonDB from classic experiments, a nucleotide-resolution genome viewer, and an
      interface that enables users to browse datasets by querying their metadata. A
      particular effort was made to automatically extract detailed experimental growth 
      conditions by implementing an assisted curation strategy applying Natural
      language processing and machine learning. We provide summaries with the total
      number of interactions found in each experiment, as well as tools to identify
      common results among different experiments. This is a long-awaited resource to
      make use of such wealth of knowledge and advance our understanding of the biology
      of the model bacterium E. coli K-12.

TI  - Enhancement of thermal stability of proteinase K by biocompatible cholinium-based
      ionic liquids.
PG  - 13057-13065
LID - 10.1039/d1cp04782e [doi]
AB  - Proteinase K (PK) is a proteolytic enzyme that has been widely used in nucleic
      acid purification, leather production, environmental protection, and other
      industrial applications. However, this biocatalyst cannot tolerate high
      temperatures which has severely restricted its wider application. As reported in 
      previous studies, cholinium-based ionic liquids (ILs) have gained tremendous
      attention serving as a promising media to stabilize and preserve proteins, DNA,
      and other biomolecules due to their environmentally benign nature and
      biocompatibility. In this work, we chose 13 different kinds of cholinium-based
      ILs to examine their effects on the thermal stability and enzymatic activity of
      PK. We found that biocompatible cholinium-based ions with appropriately chosen
      anions can greatly improve the thermal stability of PK, whose melting temperature
      (Tm) is increased from approximately 74.4 degrees C to 87.7 degrees C. However,
      the enzymatic activity is slightly reduced in the presence of ILs. Further
      comparison of our results with other literature findings suggests that
      kosmotropic anions of cholinium-based ILs are crucial to maintain the thermal
      stability of proteins. However, to achieve the best performance, the choice of IL
      anions is protein specific.

TI  - AMR-meta: a k-mer and metafeature approach to classify antimicrobial resistance
      from high-throughput short-read metagenomics data.
LID - giac029 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giac029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health concern.
      High-throughput metagenomic sequencing of microbial samples enables profiling of 
      AMR genes through comparison with curated AMR databases. However, the performance
      of current methods is often hampered by database incompleteness and the presence 
      of homology/homoplasy with other non-AMR genes in sequenced samples. RESULTS: We 
      present AMR-meta, a database-free and alignment-free approach, based on k-mers,
      which combines algebraic matrix factorization into metafeatures with regularized 
      regression. Metafeatures capture multi-level gene diversity across the main
      antibiotic classes. AMR-meta takes in reads from metagenomic shotgun sequencing
      and outputs predictions about whether those reads contribute to resistance
      against specific classes of antibiotics. In addition, AMR-meta uses an augmented 
      training strategy that joins an AMR gene database with non-AMR genes (used as
      negative examples). We compare AMR-meta with AMRPlusPlus, DeepARG, and Meta-MARC,
      further testing their ensemble via a voting system. In cross-validation, AMR-meta
      has a median f-score of 0.7 (interquartile range, 0.2-0.9). On semi-synthetic
      metagenomic data-external test-on average AMR-meta yields a 1.3-fold hit rate
      increase over existing methods. In terms of run-time, AMR-meta is 3 times faster 
      than DeepARG, 30 times faster than Meta-MARC, and as fast as AMRPlusPlus.
      Finally, we note that differences in AMR ontologies and observed variance of all 
      tools in classification outputs call for further development on standardization
      of benchmarking data and protocols. CONCLUSIONS: AMR-meta is a fast, accurate
      classifier that exploits non-AMR negative sets to improve sensitivity and
      specificity. The differences in AMR ontologies and the high variance of all tools
      in classification outputs call for the deployment of standard benchmarking data
      and protocols, to fairly compare AMR prediction tools.

TI  - Carboxylative efficacy of trans and cis MK7 and comparison with other vitamin K
      isomers.
LID - 10.1002/biof.1844 [doi]
AB  - Carboxylative enzymes are involved in many pathways and their regulation plays a 
      crucial role in many of these pathways. In particular, gamma-glutamylcarboxylase 
      (GGCX) converts glutamate residues (Glu) into gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) of the
      vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) activating them. VKDPs include at least 17
      proteins involved in processes such as blood coagulation, blood vessels
      calcification, and bone mineralization. VKDPs are activated by the reduced form
      of vitamin K, naturally occurring as vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and K2
      (menaquinones, MKs). Among these, MK7 is the most efficient in terms of
      bioavailability and biological effect. Similarly to other trans isomers, it is
      produced by natural fermentation or chemically in both trans and cis. However,
      the efficacy of the biological effect of the different isomers and the impact on 
      humans are unknown. Our study assessed carboxylative efficacy of trans and cis
      MK7 and compared it with other vitamin K isomers, evaluating both the expression 
      of residues of carboxylated Gla-protein by western blot analysis and using a
      cell-free system to determine the GGCX activity by HPLC. Trans MK7H2 showed a
      higher ability to carboxylate the 70 KDa GLA-protein, previously inhibited in
      vitro by warfarin treatment. However, cis MK7 also induced a carboxylation
      activity albeit of a small extent. The data were confirmed chromatographically,
      in which a slight carboxylative activity of cis MK7H2 was demonstrated,
      comparable with both K1H2 and oxidized trans MK7 but less than trans MK7H2 . For 
      the first time, a difference of biological activity between cis and trans
      configuration of menaquinone-7 has been reported.

      Liquid Alloy.
PG  - e202203409
LID - 10.1002/anie.202203409 [doi]
AB  - In this work, the Na-K liquid alloy with a charge selective interfacial layer is 
      developed to achieve an impressively long cycling life with small overpotential
      on a sodium super-ionic conductor solid-state electrolyte (NASICON SSE). With
      this unique multi-cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique
      model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition
      domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on this model, two charge
      selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and
      electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are
      validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic 
      characterizations. This study provides an effective design for
      high-energy-density solid-state battery with alkali Na-K anode, but also presents
      a novel approach to understand the interfacial chemical processes that could
      inspire and guide future designs.

TI  - SPRISS: Approximating Frequent K-mers by Sampling Reads, and Applications.
LID - btac180 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac180 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: The extraction of k-mers is a fundamental component in many complex
      analyses of large next-generation sequencing datasets, including reads
      classification in genomics and the characterization of RNA-seq datasets. The
      extraction of all k-mers and their frequencies is extremely demanding in terms of
      running time and memory, owing to the size of the data and to the exponential
      number of k-mers to be considered. However, in several applications, only
      frequent k-mers, which are k-mers appearing in a relatively high proportion of
      the data, are required by the analysis. RESULTS: In this work we present SPRISS, 
      a new efficient algorithm to approximate frequent k-mers and their frequencies in
      next-generation sequencing data. SPRISS employs a simple yet powerful reads
      sampling scheme, which allows to extract a representative subset of the dataset
      that can be used, in combination with any k-mer counting algorithm, to perform
      downstream analyses in a fraction of the time required by the analysis of the
      whole data, while obtaining comparable answers. Our extensive experimental
      evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of SPRISS in approximating
      frequent k-mers, and shows that it can be used in various scenarios, such as the 
      comparison of metagenomic datasets, the identification of discriminative k-mers, 
      and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping, to extract insights in a
      fraction of the time required by the analysis of the whole dataset. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Structural diversity and hydrogen storage properties in the system K-Si-H.
PG  - 13033-13039
LID - 10.1039/d2cp00298a [doi]
AB  - KSiH3 exhibits 4.1 wt% experimental hydrogen storage capacity and shows
      reversibility under moderate conditions, which provides fresh impetus to the
      search for other complex hydrides in the K-Si-H system. Here, we reproduce the
      stable Fm3m phase of K2SiH6 and uncover two denser phases, space groups P3m1 and 
      P63mc at ambient pressure, by means of first-principles structure searches. We
      note that P3m1-K2SiH6 has a high hydrogen content of 5.4 wt% and a volumetric
      density of 88.3 g L(-1). Further calculations suggest a favorable dehydrogenation
      temperature Tdes of -20.1/55.8 degrees C with decomposition into KSi + K + H2.
      The higher hydrogen density and appropriate dehydrogenation temperature indicate 
      that K2SiH6 is a promising hydrogen storage material, and our results provide
      helpful and clear guidance for further experimental studies. We found three
      further potential hydrogen storage materials stable at high pressure: K2SiH8,
      KSiH7 and KSiH8. These results suggest the need for further investigations into
      hydrogen storage materials among such ternary hydrides at high pressure.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on England's national prescriptions of oral
      vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs): an
      interrupted time series analysis (January 2019-February 2021).
PG  - 1081-1092
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2022.2078100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed as an
      alternative to warfarin to treat and prevent thromboembolism, including stroke
      prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients. The COVID-19 pandemic
      could increase the risk of stroke and/or the risk of bleeding in patients due to 
      nonadherence or sub/supra-optimal dosing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate DOAC
      prescription trends in England's community settings during the complete first
      wave of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Descriptive and interrupted time series (ITS)
      analyses were conducted to examine the prescription patterns of DOACs
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and warfarin for primary care
      patients in the English Prescribing Dataset from January 2019 to February 2021,
      with March 2020 as the cut-off point. RESULTS: A 19% increase in mean DOAC's
      accompanied with 20% warfarin prescriptions decline was observed. ITS modelling
      showed an increase in DOAC prescription volume in March 2020 (+7 million items, p
      = 0.008). The pre-existing upward trend in DOAC prescriptions slowed during the
      period (-427,000 items, p = 0.007). Apixaban was the most frequently used DOAC
      and had the largest step-change in March 2020 (+5 million items, p = 0.010). The 
      mean monthly combined cost of DOACs and warfarin was higher during the period.
      DOAC prescription trends were consistent across England's regions. Conclusion:
      The overall oral anticoagulants use in this period was lower than expected,
      indicating a medical needs gap, possibly due to adherence issues. The potential
      clinical and logistical consequences warrant further study to identify
      contributing factors and mitigate avoidable risks.

TI  - Development of a novel multi-functional integrated bioconjugate effectively
      targeting K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 232-242
LID - 10.1016/j.jpha.2021.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Folate receptor (FR) overexpression occurs in a variety of cancers, including
      pancreatic cancer. In addition, enhanced macropinocytosis exists in K-Ras mutant 
      pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the occurrence of intensive desmoplasia causes a 
      hypoxic microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. In this study, a novel
      FR-directed, macropinocytosis-enhanced, and highly cytotoxic bioconjugate folate 
      (F)-human serum albumin (HSA)-apoprotein of lidamycin (LDP)-active enediyne (AE) 
      derived from lidamycin was designed and prepared. F-HSA-LDP-AE consisted of four 
      moieties: F, HSA, LDP, and AE. F-HSA-LDP presented high binding efficiency with
      the FR and pancreatic cancer cells. Its uptake in wild-type cells was more
      extensive than in K-Ras mutant-type cells. By in vivo optical imaging, F-HSA-LDP 
      displayed prominent tumor-specific biodistribution in pancreatic cancer
      xenograft-bearing mice, showing clear and lasting tumor localization for 360 h.
      In the MTT assay, F-HSA-LDP-AE demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in three types of
      pancreatic cancer cell lines. It also induced apoptosis and caused G2/M cell
      cycle arrest. F-HSA-LDP-AE markedly suppressed the tumor growth of AsPc-1
      pancreatic cancer xenografts in athymic mice. At well-tolerated doses of 0.5 and 
      1 mg/kg, (i.v., twice), the inhibition rates were 91.2% and 94.8%, respectively
      (P<0.01). The results of this study indicate that the F-HSA-LDP multi-functional 
      bioconjugate might be effective for treating K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Blighia sapida (B. sapida) K.D. Koenig (Family Sapindaceae) is a branchless
      straight bole approximately 15 m in length. The study evaluated the antioxidant
      and anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol extract and fractions of B. sapida
      stem-bark using in vitro methods. Ethanol extract and its fractions were
      investigated for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging
      activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total antioxidant capacity
      (TAC), and quantitative phenolic and flavonoid contents. Anti-inflammatory
      activity was evaluated using albumin denaturation and membrane stabilization
      assays. The extract and its fractions exhibited radical scavenging and
      anti-inflammatory properties. The ethyl acetate fraction possessed maximum
      phenolic and flavonoid contents (136.67 +/- 1.55 gallic acid equivalent mg/g and 
      75.76 +/- 4.03 quercetin equivalent mg/g, respectively). Antioxidant studies
      revealed that the ethyl acetate fraction displayed superior activity with an IC50
      = 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg/mL DPPH, and values of 146.96 +/- 3.81 ascorbic acid
      equivalent (AAE) mg/g and 359.20 +/- 4.98 AAE mg/g for FRAP and TAC,
      respectively. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity was revealed by
      inhibition of heat-induced albumin denaturation and red blood cell membrane
      stabilization at concentrations of 200-1000 mug/mL and 50-250 mug/mL,
      respectively. The ethanol extract and fractions exhibited antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory activities, with ethyl acetate fraction showing superior
      activity, which could be attributed to secondary metabolites, mainly phenolic
      compounds. Overall, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of B. sapida
      can be exploited by ethnomedicinal users.

TI  - The K-Ras(G12D)-inhibitory peptide KS-58 suppresses growth of murine CT26
      colorectal cancer cell-derived tumors.
PG  - 8121

AB  - Mutations in the cell proliferation regulator K-Ras are found with a variety of
      cancer types, so drugs targeting these mutant proteins could hold great clinical 
      potential. Very recently, a drug targeting the K-Ras(G12C) mutant observed in
      lung cancer gained regulatory approval and several clinical trials are currently 
      underway to examine the efficacy of this agent when combined with other drugs
      such as a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of programmed cell death 1 receptor
      (anti-PD-1). Alternatively, there are currently no approved drugs targeting
      K-Ras(G12D), the most common cancer-associated K-Ras mutant. In 2020, we
      described the development of the K-Ras(G12D) inhibitory bicyclic peptide KS-58
      and presented evidence for anticancer activity against mouse xenografts derived
      from the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 stably expressing K-Ras(G12D). 
      Here, we show that KS-58 also possess anticancer activity against mouse tumors
      derived from the colorectal cancer cell line CT26 stably expressing K-Ras(G12D). 
      Further, KS-58 treatment reduced phosphorylation of ERK, a major downstream
      signaling factor in the Ras pathway, confirming that KS-58 inhibits K-Ras(G12D)
      function. Unexpectedly; however, KS-58 did not show additive or synergistic
      anticancer activity with mouse anti-PD-1. Morphological analysis and
      immunostaining demonstrated no obvious differences in CD8(+) cells infiltration
      or PD-L1 expression levels in CT26-derived tumors exposed to monotherapy or
      combination treatment. Nonetheless, KS-58 demonstrated reasonable stability in
      blood (t1/2 approximately 30 min) and no obvious systemic adverse effects,
      suggesting clinical potential as a lead molecule against colorectal cancer.

TI  - Building alternative consensus trees and supertrees using k-means and Robinson
      and Foulds distance.
LID - btac326 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac326 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Each gene has its own evolutionary history which can substantially
      differ from evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual
      genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer or
      recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be
      represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary
      patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical
      descent. However, the output of traditional consensus tree or supertree inference
      methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. RESULTS: We present a new
      efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and
      supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a given 
      set of gene phylogenies. We show how an adapted version of the popular k-means
      clustering algorithm, based on some remarkable properties of the Robinson and
      Foulds distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (for
      homogeneous data) or multiple (for heterogeneous data) cluster(s) of trees.
      Moreover, we adapt the popular Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and 
      Gap cluster validity indices to tree clustering with k-means. Special attention
      is given to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative
      supertrees. The use of the Euclidean property of the objective function of the
      method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus
      better suited for analyzing large evolutionary datasets. AVAILABILITY AND
      IMPLEMENTATION: Our KMeansSuperTreeClustering program along with its C ++ source 
      code is available at: https://github.com/TahiriNadia/KMeansSuperTreeClustering.
      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

      adolescents: comparison of K-wire and locking plate fixation.
PG  - 17531934221098006
LID - 10.1177/17531934221098006 [doi]
AB  - This retrospective study reviewed 28 patients, aged 10 to 17 years, who underwent
      corrective osteotomy for malunion of the proximal phalangeal distal condyles at a
      mean of 9 weeks (range 2-52) from injury. There were 19 patients treated with
      K-wire and nine patients with locking plates. The two groups were comparable for 
      trauma mechanism, fracture type, time delay from injury and the type of initial
      treatment. The K-wire group had a shorter duration of operation and shorter time 
      to union than the plating group. For both groups, postoperative radiographs
      showed significant correction, which remained unchanged until the final follow-up
      (minimum 12 months), although greater residual coronal angulation was found in
      the K-wire group. The outcomes in 17 of the 28 patients were graded as excellent 
      or good according to the Al-Qattan classification, with no difference between the
      groups. The complication rate was also similar between the groups, while the
      locking plate group had a higher rate of secondary surgery.Level of evidence:
      III.

TI  - Distributed k-Winners-Take-All Network: An Optimization Perspective.
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2022.3170236 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we proposed an equivalent formulation of the k-winners-take-all 
      (k-WTA) problem as a constrained optimization problem by including the Laplacian 
      matrix of the undirected connected communication graph to adapt to the
      distributed computing scenario, where an additional auxiliary variable is
      introduced. To solve the optimization problem in a distributed fashion, we design
      projection neural networks by using the convex optimization theory, leading to
      the emergence of a distributed k-WTA network. Our theoretical analysis shows that
      the proposed distributed k-WTA network has a globally asymptotically stable
      equilibrium that is identical to the optimal solution to the optimization
      problem, that is, the correct k-WTA solution. The effectiveness and advantages,
      including the extendability to constrained k-WTA problems, of the proposed k-WTA 
      network are demonstrated via simulations.

TI  - Sparse Index Tracking With K-Sparsity or epsilon-Deviation Constraint via
      l(0)-Norm Minimization.
LID - 10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3171819 [doi]
AB  - Sparse index tracking, as one of the passive investment strategies, is to track a
      benchmark financial index via constructing a portfolio with a few assets in a
      market index. It can be considered as parameter learning in an adaptive system,
      in which we periodically update the selected assets and their investment
      percentages based on the sliding window approach. However, many existing
      algorithms for sparse index tracking cannot explicitly and directly control the
      number of assets or the tracking error. This article formulates sparse index
      tracking as two constrained optimization problems and then proposes two
      algorithms, namely, nonnegative orthogonal matching pursuit with projected
      gradient descent (NNOMP-PGD) and alternating direction method of multipliers for 
      l(0)-norm (ADMM-l(0)). The NNOMP-PGD aims at minimizing the tracking error
      subject to the number of selected assets </= a predefined number. With the
      NNOMP-PGD, investors can directly and explicitly control the number of selected
      assets. The ADMM-l(0) aims at minimizing the number of selected assets subject to
      the tracking error that is upper bounded by a preset threshold. It can directly
      and explicitly control the tracking error. The convergence of the two proposed
      algorithms is also presented. With our algorithms, investors can explicitly and
      directly control the number of selected assets or the tracking error of the
      resultant portfolio. In addition, numerical experiments demonstrate that the
      proposed algorithms outperform the existing approaches.

TI  - A k-space-based method to measure and correct for temporal B0 field variations in
      MR temperature imaging.
PG  - 1098-1111
LID - 10.1002/mrm.29275 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Present a method to use change in phase in repeated Cartesian k-space
      measurements to monitor the change in magnetic field for dynamic MR temperature
      imaging. METHODS: The method is applied to focused ultrasound heating experiments
      in a gelatin phantom and an ex vivo salt pork sample, without and with simulated 
      respiratory motion. RESULTS: In each experiment, phase variations due to B0 field
      drift and respiration were readily apparent in the measured phase difference.
      With correction, the SD of the temperature over time was reduced from 0.18
      degrees C to 0.14 degrees C (no breathing) and from 0.81 degrees C to 0.22
      degrees C (with breathing) for the gelatin phantom, and from 0.68 degrees C to
      0.13 degrees C (no breathing) and from 1.06 degrees C to 0.17 degrees C (with
      breathing) for the pork sample. The accuracy in nonheated regions, assessed as
      the RMS error deviation from 0 degrees C, improved from 1.70 degrees C to 1.11
      degrees C (no breathing) and from 4.73 degrees C to 1.47 degrees C (with
      breathing) for the gelatin phantom, and from 5.95 degrees C to 0.88 degrees C (no
      breathing) and from 13.40 degrees C to 1.73 degrees C (with breathing) for the
      pork sample. The correction did not affect the temperature measurement accuracy
      in the heated regions. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that phase changes
      resulting from variations in B0 due to drift and respiration, commonly seen in MR
      thermometry applications, can be measured directly from 3D Cartesian acquisition 
      methods. The correction of temporal field variations using the presented
      technique improved temperature accuracy, reduced variability in nonheated
      regions, and did not reduce accuracy in heated regions.

TI  - 2D phosphorus carbide as promising anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries from
      first-principles study.

AB  - First-principles calculations based on density functional theory were used to
      investigate the electrochemical performance of monolayer gamma-PC for Na- and
      K-ion batteries. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the monolayer
      gamma-PC have the thermal and dynamic stability. A substantial charge transfer
      from the Na/K atoms to the gamma-PC sheet enhances the electrical conductivity of
      gamma-PC. The results show that the adsorption energies of Na and K are 1.53 eV
      and 2.04 eV, respectively, which are much higher than Na/K bulk cohesive energy
      and sufficiently ensure stability and safety. Additionally, the low diffusion
      barriers on gamma-PC monolayer are 0.034 eV for Na and 0.027 eV for K, indicating
      excellent rate performance. The gamma-PC sheet has a high theoretical capacity
      for both Na (519.9 mAh/g) and K (326.6 mAh/g) ion batteries, which can satisfy
      the requirement of energy storage devices to anode materials. Our results
      strongly suggest that 2D gamma-PC monolayer is an exceedingly promising anode
      material for both NIBs and KIBs with high adsorption energies, high capacity, and
      low diffusion barriers.

AB  - Learning the subtype of dyslexia may help shorten the rehabilitation process and 
      focus more on the relevant special education or diet for children with dyslexia. 
      For this purpose, the resting-state eyes-open 2-min QEEG measurement data were
      collected from 112 children with dyslexia (84 male, 28 female) between 7 and 11
      years old for 96 sessions per subject on average. The z-scores are calculated for
      each band power and each channel, and outliers are eliminated afterward. Using
      the k-Means clustering method, three different clusters are identified. Cluster 1
      (19% of the cases) has positive z-scores for theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2, and
      gamma-band powers in all channels. Cluster 2 (76% of the cases) has negative
      z-scores for theta, alpha, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma-band powers in all channels.
      Cluster 3 (5% of the cases) has positive z-scores for theta, alpha, beta-1,
      beta-2, and gamma-band powers at AF3, F3, FC5, and T7 channels and mostly
      negative z-scores for other channels. In Cluster 3, there is temporal disruption 
      which is a typical description of dyslexia. In Cluster 1, there is a general
      brain inflammation as both slow and fast waves are detected in the same channels.
      In Cluster 2, there is a brain maturation delay and a mild inflammation. After
      Auto Train Brain training, most of the cases resemble more of Cluster 2, which
      may mean that inflammation is reduced and brain maturation delay comes up to the 
      surface which might be the result of inflammation. Moreover, Cluster 2 center
      values at the posterior parts of the brain shift toward the mean values at these 
      channels after 60 sessions. It means, Auto Train Brain training improves the
      posterior parts of the brain for children with dyslexia, which were the most
      relevant regions to be strengthened for dyslexia.

      Activities of Hydro-Ethanolic Leaf and Bark Extracts of Psychotria densinervia
      (K. Krause) Verdc.
PG  - 8459943
LID - 10.1155/2022/8459943 [doi]
AB  - Psychotria densinervia hydro-ethanolic leaf extract (PHELE) and bark extract
      (PHEBE) were evaluated for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and inhibition of
      digestive enzymes activities. The antioxidant activity was characterized by
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
      2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing
      antioxidant power (FRAP), total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid
      content (TFC) assays. The anti-inflammatory activity was characterized by protein
      denaturation and antiproteinase tests, while the inhibition of the enzymes was
      assessed using alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, lipase, and cholesterol esterase
      activities. PHELE presented low (p < 0.001) IC50 (59.09 +/- 5.97 mug/ml) for DPPH
      compared with ascorbic acid (71.78 +/- 6.37 mug/ml) and PHEBE (115.40 +/- 1.21
      mug/ml). The IC50 of PHELE (262.4 +/- 4.46 mug/ml) and PHEBE (354.2 +/- 1.97
      mug/ml) was higher (p < 0.001) than that of catechin (33.48 +/- 2.02 mug/ml) for 
      ABTS. PHELE had high (p < 0.001) FRAP (341.73 +/- 21.70 mg CE/g) than PHEBE
      (150.30 +/- 0.32 mg CE/g). PHELE presented (p < 0.001) high TPC (270.05 +/- 7.53 
      mg CE/g) and TFC (23.43 +/- 0.032 mg CE/g) than PHEBE (TPC: 138.89 +/- 0.91 and
      TFC: 20.06 +/- 0.032 mg CE/g). PHELE showed antiprotein denaturation with IC50
      (257.0 +/- 7.51 mug/ml) (p < 0.001) and antiproteinase activity (74.37 +/- 1.10
      mug/ml) lower than PHEBE (316.1 +/- 6.02 mug/ml and 177.6 +/- 0.50 mug/ml),
      respectively. Orlistat inhibited lipase (p < 0.001) activity with IC50 (37.11 +/-
      4.39 mug/ml) lower than PHELE and PHEBE (50.57 +/- 2.89 mug/ml and 62.88 +/- 1.74
      mug/ml, respectively). PHELE inhibited cholesterol esterase with IC50 (34.75 +/- 
      3.87 mug/ml) lower than orlistat (54.61 +/- 2.56) and PHEBE (80.14 +/- 1.71
      mug/ml). PHELE inhibited alpha-amylase IC50 (6.07 +/- 4.05 mug/ml) lower than
      PHEBE (19.69 +/- 6.27 mug/ml) and acarbose (20.01 +/- 2.84 mug/ml). Acarbose
      inhibited alpha-glucosidase (p < 0.001) activity with IC50 (4.11 +/- 3.47 mug/ml)
      lower than PHELE (24.41 +/- 2.84 mug/ml) and PHEBE (38.81 +/- 2.46 mug/ml). PHELE
      presented better antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and enzyme inhibition activity
      than PHEBE.

TI  - Effects of S and Al on K Migration and Transformation during Coal and Biomass
      Co-combustion.
PG  - 15880-15891
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c00994 [doi]
AB  - The co-combustion of biomass and coal has both environmental and economic
      benefits in terms of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. However, one of the
      key factors affecting the feasibility of this technology is the ash deposition
      and corrosion caused by the high alkali metal content of biomass, especially K.
      After the addition of elemental S to corn stalk/Xiaolongtan lignite blended fuel 
      and Al2O3 to corn stalk/Datong lignite, combustion experiments were carried out
      in a tubular furnace to explore the effects of S and Al in coal on K migration
      and transformation. The experimental results show that when S/K < 6, an increase 
      in the S/K ratio inhibited the release of K. When S/K > 6, the sulfation become
      saturated, and an increase in S promoted the release of K. When S/K = 6, the
      higher the temperature was, and the more obvious the inhibitory effect on the
      release of K was. Increasing the S/K ratio not only increased the CaSO4 content
      of the ash but also increased the content of water-soluble K compounds, such as
      K2SO4, and decreased the contents of acid-soluble K compounds and insoluble K
      compounds, such as KAlSi3O8. After Al2O3 was added, as the Al/K ratio increased, 
      the K release rate gradually decreased. When the sample with Al/K = 2.5 and the
      original samples were burned at 600-700 degrees C, the difference in the K
      release rates of the two samples was relatively small. When the temperature was
      higher than 700 degrees C, the higher the temperature was, and the greater the
      difference in the K release rates of the samples was, which indicates that a high
      temperature promotes the formation of aluminosilicates containing K.

TI  - Recent studies on the pharmacological activities and structural modifications of 
      compound K.
LID - 10.2174/1389557522666220513120828 [doi]
AB  - : Ginsenosides, the essential active ingredients extracted from ginseng, have
      been well studied in the past several decades because of their numerous
      pharmacological properties including antit-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and
      anti-diabetic activities, as well as hepatoprotection, skin protection, and
      memory improvement, etc. Compound K (CK) is the major metabolite derived from the
      deglycosylation of ginsenosides by intestinal bacteria and has been proved to be 
      the actual active entity absorbed into the systemic circulation. In this review, 
      we comprehensively elucidate the pharmacological activities of CK from the

AB  - The "hydrogen atom" of magnetic Weyl semimetals, with the minimum number of Weyl 
      points, has received growing attention recently due to the possible presence of
      Weyl-related phenomena. Here, we report a nontrivial electronic structure of the 
      ferromagnetic alluaudite-type compound K_{2}Mn_{3}(AsO_{4})_{3}. It exhibits only
      a pair of Weyl points constrained in the z direction by the twofold rotation
      symmetry, leading to extremely long Fermi arc surface states. In addition, the
      study of its low-energy effective model results in the discovery of various
      topological superconducting states, such as the hydrogen atom of a Weyl
      superconductor. Our Letter provides a feasible platform to explore the intrinsic 
      properties related to Weyl points, and the related device applications.

AB  - Polymeric hydrogels are increasingly considered as scaffolds for tissue
      engineering due to their extraordinary resemblance with the extracellular matrix 
      (ECM) of many tissues. As cell adhesion is a key factor in regulating important
      cell functions, hydrogel scaffolds are often functionalized or loaded with a
      variety of bioactive molecules that can promote adhesion. Interesting biomimetic 
      approaches exploit the properties of mussel-inspired recombinant adhesive
      proteins. In this work, we prepared hydrogel scaffolds with a 50%w mixture of
      k-carrageenan (kC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), by a two-step physical gelation
      process, and we coated them with Perna viridis foot protein-5beta (Pvfp5beta).
      The mechanical and morphological properties of hydrogels were investigated both
      after conditioning with typical cell culture media and also after coating with
      the Pvfp5beta. The protein resulted strongly adsorbed onto the surface of the
      hydrogel and also able to penetrate in its interiors to a certain depth, mainly
      interacting with the kC component of the scaffold as resulted from the confocal
      analysis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts NIH-3T3 were seeded on top of the hydrogels
      and cultured up to two weeks. The role of Pvfp5beta in promoting cell adhesion,
      spreading and colonization of the scaffold was demonstrated.

TI  - Pharmacological inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase induces neurovascular
      degeneration and glial cell alteration in the rat retina.
PG  - 109107

AB  - Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) plays an important role in ion homeostasis and
      neurotransmitter uptake. In the retina, multidirectional communications among
      neurons, glia, and blood vessels (that is, neuro-glio-vascular interaction) are
      crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis. We investigated the role of NKA in
      the elements of neuro-glio-vascular unit in neonatal and adult rat retinas. Male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats (1- and 8-week-old) were injected intravitreally with ouabain
      (20 nmol/eye), an inhibitor of NKA. Morphological changes in retinal neurons,
      glia, and blood vessels were examined. The intravitreal injection of ouabain
      decreased the number of cells in the ganglion cell layer, as well as the
      thicknesses of the inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers in neonatal and adult
      rats compared to age-matched controls. The ouabain-induced neuronal cell damage
      was partially prevented by D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, an antagonist
      of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors. In the deep retinal vascular plexus of the
      ouabain-injected eyes, angiogenesis was delayed in neonatal rats, whereas
      capillary degeneration occurred in adult rats. The immunoreactivity of glutamine 
      synthetase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) decreased in the retinas
      of neonatal and adult rats injected intravitreally with ouabain. The
      immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein was enhanced in the retinas
      of ouabain-injected adult eyes. After the ouabain injection, CD45-positive
      leukocytes and Iba1-positive microglia increased in the inner retinal layer of
      neonatal rats, whereas they increased in the middle retinal layer of adult rats. 
      These results suggest that the inhibition of NKA induces the degeneration of
      neuronal and vascular cells and alteration of glial cells in both neonatal and
      adult retinas. In addition to the direct effects of NKA inhibition, the
      disturbance of retinal glutamate metabolism and decreased VEGF expression may
      contribute to neurovascular degeneration. The activity of NKA is crucial for
      maintaining elements of neuro-glio-vascular unit in the retina.

      and compatible energy levels with near-infrared (NIR) absorbing nonfullerene
      acceptors is highly important for realizing high-performance organic solar cells 
      (OSCs). Herein, a new thiophene-fused diazabenzo[k]fluoranthene derivative is
      successfully synthesized as the electron-deficient unit to construct an efficient
      donor-acceptor (D-A) type alternating copolymer donor, namely, PABF-Cl, using the
      chlorinated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene as the copolymerization unit. PABF-Cl 
      exhibits a wide optical bandgap of 1.93 eV, a deep highest occupied molecular
      level of -5.36 eV, and efficient hole transport. As a result, OSCs with the best 
      power conversion efficiency of 11.8% are successfully obtained by using PABF-Cl
      as the donor to blend with a NIR absorbing BTP-eC9 acceptor. This work provides a
      new design of electron-deficient unit for constructing high-performance D-A type 
      polymer donors.

TI  - Estimation of Vitamin K Content and Its Sources in the Diet of the Polish
      Participants of the PURE Study.

LID - 10.3390/nu14091917 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to estimate the content of K1, K2 (MK-n) as well as
      total K vitamins and their sources in the diets of 1985 PURE Poland study
      participants based on the FFQ questionnaire. Due to the pleiotropic effect of K
      vitamins, it is important to know their food sources depending on different
      eating habits. Total vitamin K in the diets amounted to 331.1 +/- 151.5 microg/d 
      and 358.6 +/- 181.0 microg/d for men and women, respectively. Dietary patterns
      (DPs) were identified in the study group, and the relationship between them and
      vitamin K intake was assessed. The proportion of dominant products as sources of 
      vitamin K in the fourth quartile of each of the three identified DPs did not
      change significantly compared to the proportion of these products as sources of
      vitamin K in all subjects. In the fourth quartile of individual DPs, vitamin K1
      came mainly from vegetables (56.5-76.8%); K2 mainly from processed meat and
      high-fat cheese and cream (70.1-77.6%); and total K mainly from vegetables and
      processed meat (57.6-67.8%). Intakes of K vitamins were high and similar in terms
      of predominant vitamin K provider products, in groups of subjects whose diets
      were most consistent with the particular DP. In the absence of global findings on
      the most appropriate dietary content of MK-n vitamins other than phylloquinone,
      the estimated high content of these vitamins in the diets of the subjects
      compared with other nations suggests that their level in diets was satisfactory. 
      Future studies should aim to determine the need for MK-n vitamins in terms of
      fulfilling all their functions in the body.

TI  - Exploring the Negative and Gap-Widening Effects of EdTech on Young Children's
      Learning Achievement: Evidence from a Longitudinal Dataset of Children in
      American K-3 Classrooms.
LID - 5430 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19095430 [doi]
AB  - Introducing educational technology (EdTech) into school classrooms constitutes
      one of the strongest educational reforms of recent decades worldwide, and as a
      discursive or ideological background of it, there has been the optimistic
      consensus on the use of EdTech among the global education community. In this
      context, this study highlights the dark side of EdTech and provides an
      opportunity for critical self-reflection of its current use through a series of
      quantitative analyses on a longitudinal dataset of children in K-3 American
      classrooms collected during the first half of the 2010s (ECLS-K:2011). In this
      process, two adverse effects of EdTech on young children's learning achievement
      are identified: the negative effect and the gap-widening effect. These findings
      convey the crucial message that the education community's approaches to EdTech
      should be more prudent than the current optimistic consensus. These findings do
      not lead us to any extreme or rigid conclusion such as techno-determinism or
      neo-Luddism, but rather call for a balanced and realistic deliberation on the
      benefits and risks of technology. This point is particularly worth clarifying in 
      the recent situation, where schools' dependence on EdTech has inevitably
      increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Densely woven highly crystallized biocompatible sodium-potassium niobate
      Na0.35K0.65NbO3 fibers with an average diameter of 100-200 nm and several
      hundreds of microns in length were sintered by the sol-gel calcination-assisted
      electrospinning technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed preferential cube-on-cube [001] 
      orientation of nanocrystals within the fiber's body, separated by a low angle
      grain boundary. The Williamson-Hall method was employed to analyze the broadening
      of XRD reflections and to accurately determine the size and intrinsic strain of
      nanocrystal fiber aggregates. The main objective of this article is to test the
      potential capacity of direct XRD analysis to noninvasively control crystallite
      size and lattice distortion in core-shell coaxial nanofibers.

      K-Ion Batteries.
LID - 1436 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12091436 [doi]
AB  - The necessity for large scale and sustainable energy storage systems is
      increasing. Lithium-ion batteries have been extensively utilized over the past
      decades for a range of applications including electronic devices and electric
      vehicles due to their distinguishing characteristics. Nevertheless, their massive
      deployment can be questionable due to use of critical materials as well as
      limited lithium resources and growing costs of extraction. One of the emerging
      alternative candidates is potassium-ion battery technology due to potassium's
      extensive reserves along with its physical and chemical properties similar to
      lithium. The challenge to develop anode materials with good rate capability,
      stability and high safety yet remains. Iron oxides are potentially promising
      anodes for both battery systems due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost 
      and abundant reserves, which aligns with the targets of large-scale application
      and limited environmental footprint. However, they present relevant limitations
      such as low electronic conductivity, significant volume changes and inadequate
      energy efficiency. In this review, we discuss some recent design strategies of
      iron oxide-based materials for both electrochemical systems and highlight the
      relationships of their structure performance in nanostructured anodes. Finally,
      we outline challenges and opportunities for these materials for possible
      development of KIBs as a complementary technology to LIBs.

TI  - Role of Vitamin K in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Focus on Bone and Cardiovascular
      Health.
LID - 5282 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23095282 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly associated with vitamin K deficiency.
      Some of the serious complications of CKD are represented by cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) and skeletal fragility with an increased risk of morbidity and
      mortality. A complex pathogenetic link between hormonal and ionic disturbances,
      bone tissue and metabolism alterations, and vascular calcification (VC) exists
      and has been defined as chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder
      (CKD-MBD). Poor vitamin K status seems to have a key role in the progression of
      CKD, but also in the onset and advance of both bone and cardiovascular
      complications. Three forms of vitamin K are currently known: vitamin K1
      (phylloquinone), vitamin K2 (menaquinone), and vitamin K3 (menadione). Vitamin K 
      plays different roles, including in activating vitamin K-dependent proteins
      (VKDPs) and in modulating bone metabolism and contributing to the inhibition of
      VC. This review focuses on the biochemical and functional characteristics of
      vitamin K vitamers, suggesting this nutrient as a possible marker of kidney, CV, 
      and bone damage in the CKD population and exploring its potential use for
      promoting health in this clinical setting. Treatment strategies for
      CKD-associated osteoporosis and CV disease should include vitamin K
      supplementation. However, further randomized clinical studies are needed to
      assess the safety and the adequate dosage to prevent these CKD complications.

TI  - Populus euphratica Phospholipase Ddelta Increases Salt Tolerance by Regulating
      K(+)/Na(+) and ROS Homeostasis in Arabidopsis.
LID - 4911 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094911 [doi]
AB  - Phospholipase Dalpha (PLDalpha), which produces signaling molecules phosphatidic 
      acid (PA), has been shown to play a critical role in plants adapting to salt
      environments. However, it is unclear whether phospholipase Ddelta (PLDdelta) can 
      mediate the salt response in higher plants. PePLDdelta was isolated from
      salt-resistant Populus euphratica and transferred to Arabidopsis thaliana to
      testify the salt tolerance of transgenic plants. The NaCl treatment (130 mM)
      reduced the root growth and whole-plant fresh weight of wild-type (WT) A.
      thaliana, vector controls (VC) and PePLDdelta-overexpressed lines, although a
      less pronounced effect was observed in transgenic plants. Under salt treatment,
      PePLDdelta-transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited lower electrolyte leakage,
      malondialdehyde content and H2O2 levels than WT and VC, resulting from the
      activated antioxidant enzymes and upregulated transcripts of genes encoding
      superoxide dismutase, ascorbic acid peroxidase and peroxidase. In addition,
      PePLDdelta-overexpressed plants increased the transcription of genes encoding the
      plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter (AtSOS1) and H(+)-ATPase (AtAHA2), which
      enabled transgenic plants to proceed with Na(+) extrusion and reduce K(+) loss
      under salinity. The capacity to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
      K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis was associated with the abundance of specific PA species
      in plants overexpressing PePLDdelta. PePLDdelta-transgenic plants retained a
      typically higher abundance of PA species, 34:2 (16:0-18:2), 34:3 (16:0-18:3),
      36:4 (18:2-18:2), 36:5 (18:2-18:3) and 36:6 (18:3-18:3), under control and saline
      conditions. It is noteworthy that PA species 34:2 (16:0-18:2), 34:3 (16:0-18:3), 
      36:4 (18:2-18:2) and 36:5 (18:2-18:3) markedly increased in response to NaCl in
      transgenic plants. In conclusion, we suppose that PePLDdelta-derived PA enhanced 
      the salinity tolerance by regulating ROS and K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis in
      Arabidopsis.

TI  - Changes in Astroglial K(+) upon Brief Periods of Energy Deprivation in the Mouse 
      Neocortex.
LID - 4836 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094836 [doi]
AB  - Malfunction of astrocytic K(+) regulation contributes to the breakdown of
      extracellular K(+) homeostasis during ischemia and spreading depolarization
      events. Studying astroglial K(+) changes is, however, hampered by a lack of
      suitable techniques. Here, we combined results from fluorescence imaging,
      ion-selective microelectrodes, and patch-clamp recordings in murine neocortical
      slices with the calculation of astrocytic [K(+)]. Brief chemical ischemia caused 
      a reversible ATP reduction and a transient depolarization of astrocytes.
      Moreover, astrocytic [Na(+)] increased by 24 mM and extracellular [Na(+)]
      decreased. Extracellular [K(+)] increased, followed by an undershoot during
      recovery. Feeding these data into the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation revealed a
      baseline astroglial [K(+)] of 146 mM, an initial K(+) loss by 43 mM upon chemical
      ischemia, and a transient K(+) overshoot of 16 mM during recovery. It also
      disclosed a biphasic mismatch in astrocytic Na(+)/K(+) balance, which was
      initially ameliorated, but later aggravated by accompanying changes in pH and
      bicarbonate, respectively. Altogether, our study predicts a loss of K(+) from
      astrocytes upon chemical ischemia followed by a net gain. The overshooting K(+)
      uptake will promote low extracellular K(+) during recovery, likely exerting a
      neuroprotective effect. The resulting late cation/anion imbalance requires
      additional efflux of cations and/or influx of anions, the latter eventually
      driving delayed astrocyte swelling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is often used as a proxy measure for the
      mental health of a population. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10) is
      a widely used brief screening tool for psychological distress, yet few studies
      have evaluated its utility in sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated its construct
      validity and factor structure in Uganda. METHODS: We used data from an ongoing
      case-control study. Participants in the present study were patients seeking
      general medical outpatient services and caretakers of mentally ill persons.
      Demographic data were collected using a structured questionnaire, and
      psychological distress was assessed using the K-10. K-10 construct validity and
      factorial structure were assessed through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: A total of 2104 participants were
      included in this analysis, these were controls from a general medical setting.
      The mean K-10 score was 2.34 with an internal consistency of 0.86. EFA resulted
      in a two-factor solution that accounted for 78.37% of the variance. CFA revealed 
      that a unidimensional model of psychological distress with correlated errors
      between some of K-10 items was superior, with a comparative fit index of 0.95,
      Tucker-Lewis index of 0.93, and a root mean square error of approximation of
      0.08. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited to evaluating internal consistency and
      construct validity. Future studies are warranted to examine criterion validity
      and establish cut-offs for psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The K-10 had good
      psychometric properties in this population and may be useful for measuring broad 
      psychological distress in general medical settings.

TI  - The potassium channel GhAKT2bD is regulated by CBL-CIPK calcium signalling
      complexes and facilitates K(+) allocation in cotton.
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14377 [doi]
AB  - Efficient allocation of the essential nutrient potassium (K(+) ) is a central
      determinant of plant ion homeostasis and involves AKT2 K(+) channels. Here, we
      characterize four AKT2 K(+) channels from cotton and report that xylem and phloem
      expressed GhAKT2bD facilitates K(+) allocation and that AKT2-silencing impairs
      plant growth and development. We uncover kinase activity-dependent activation of 
      GhAKT2bD-mediated K(+) uptake by AtCBL4-GhCIPK1 calcium signalling complexes in
      HEK293T cells. Moreover, AtCBL4-AtCIPK6 complexes known to convey activation of
      AtAKT2 in Arabidopsis also activate cotton GhAKT2bD in HEK293T cells.
      Collectively, these findings reveal an essential role for AKT2 in the source-sink
      allocation of K(+) in cotton and identify GhAKT2bD as subject to complex
      regulation by CBL-CIPK Ca(2+) sensor-kinase complexes.

TI  - Protein-protein interaction network of E. coli K-12 has significant
      high-dimensional cavities: new insights from algebraic topological studies.
PG  - 1406-1418
LID - 10.1002/2211-5463.13437 [doi]
AB  - As a model system, Escherichia coli has been used to study various life
      processes. A dramatic paradigm shift has occurred in recent years, with the study
      of single proteins moving toward the study of dynamically interacting proteins,
      especially protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, despite the
      importance of PPI networks, little is known about the intrinsic nature of the
      network structure, especially high-dimensional topological properties. By
      introducing general hypergeometric distribution, we reconstruct a statistically
      reliable combined PPI network of E. coli (E. coli-PPI-Network) from several
      datasets. Unlike traditional graph analysis, algebraic topology was introduced to
      analyze the topological structures of the E. coli-PPI-Network, including
      high-dimensional cavities and cycles. Random networks with the same node and edge
      number (RandomNet) or scale-free networks with the same degree distribution
      (RandomNet-SameDD) were produced as controls. We discovered that the E.
      coli-PPI-Network had special algebraic typological structures, exhibiting more
      high-dimensional cavities and cycles, compared to RandomNets or, importantly,
      RandomNet-SameDD. Based on these results, we defined degree of involved
      q-dimensional cycles of proteins (q-DCprotein ) in the network, a novel concept
      that relies on the integral structure of the network and is different from
      traditional node degree or hubs. Finally, top proteins ranked by their
      1-DCprotein were identified (such as gmhB, rpoA, rplB, rpsF and yfgB). In
      conclusion, by introducing mathematical and computer technologies, we discovered 
      novel algebraic topological properties of the E. coli-PPI-Network, which has
      special high-dimensional cavities and cycles, and thereby revealed certain
      intrinsic rules of information flow underlining bacteria biology.

TI  - Midwives' Perspectives about Vitamin K Prophylaxis Against Vitamin K Deficiency
      Bleeding of the Newborn.
PG  - 1641-1648
LID - 10.1007/s10995-022-03423-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends one intramuscular (IM) 
      vitamin K injection at birth to prevent Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding of the
      Newborn (VKDB). Among factors associated with IM vitamin K refusal, investigators
      have reported an increased frequency of IM vitamin K refusal among parents who
      select midwife-assisted deliveries. Reasons behind this association are unclear. 
      METHODS: To understand the perspectives of midwives on IM vitamin K prophylaxis
      and approach to counseling parents using qualitative methodology, we conducted
      in-depth semi-structured interviews of midwives associated with 3 tertiary
      academic medical centers and surrounding communities in Connecticut, Iowa and
      Michigan. We used the grounded theory approach and the constant comparative
      method until saturation was reached. RESULTS: We interviewed 19 white female
      midwives from different training pathways. Participants who were Certified Nurse 
      Midwives (CNMs) routinely recommended IM vitamin K prophylaxis and Certified
      Professional Midwives (CPMs) took a more neutral approach. The following 4 themes
      emerged: (1) Emphasis on an educational approach to counseling that supports
      parents' decision-making authority; (2) Low-intervention philosophy in the
      midwifery model of care attracts certain parents; (3) Need for relationship
      building between midwives and pediatricians and (4) Opportunities for the future.
      CONCLUSIONS: Midwives in our study perceived that the midwifery model of care,
      the focus on physiologic birth and prioritizing parents' decision-making autonomy
      appears to attract a sub-set of expectant parents with certain belief systems who
      question interventions such as IM vitamin K prophylaxis. There are opportunities 
      for better collaboration between midwives and pediatricians.

AB  - This special section is dedicated to some of the recent work by Dr. Angela
      Stevens, who passed away unexpectedly last year. She is dearly missed by those
      fortunate enough to have known her, but her legacy lives on through the lives she
      touched and her research. Since the beginning of her undergraduate training, Dr. 
      Angela Stevens has dedicated her professional life to improving the lives of
      people who use drugs and alcohol through research. During her doctoral training
      at Texas Tech University, her research program focused on risk and protective
      factors which influence alcohol and cannabis use based on the theory of planned
      behavior. Dr. Stevens' master's thesis utilized daily diary methodology to
      examine the within-person intention-behavior relation for alcohol use among a
      sample of young adults (Stevens et al., 2017). This work indicated that
      individuals higher in phenotypes related to problematic drinking (i.e.,
      impulsigenic traits) had stronger intentions to drink, which in turn predicted
      higher levels of alcohol consumption. Building on this work, her dissertation
      (Stevens et al., 2020) involved a psychometric evaluation of a momentary
      impulsivity scale across two intensive longitudinal samples using ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA). This work informed the assessment of state-level
      factors relevant to substance use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all

TI  - K-Doped Graphitic Carbon Nitride with Obvious Less Electrode Passivation for
      Highly Stable Electrochemiluminescence and Its Sensitive Sensing Analysis of
      MicroRNA.
PG  - 7191-7199
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05440 [doi]
AB  - In this study, upon potassium (K) element doping, the electrochemiluminescence
      (ECL) excitation potential of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) obviously shifted
      from -1.57 to -0.74 V. Compared with other reported methods, this work was the
      first one that could reduce the ECL excitation potential of g-C3N4 to below the
      critical value of -0.9 V. It could more effectively overcome electrode
      passivation and significantly improve the ECL intensity and stability. Meanwhile,
      the lower excitation potential could significantly reduce other side reactions
      caused by high voltage, and the introduction of the K element could obviously
      increase the water solubility to shorten the preparation time. The apparent
      decrease of the excitation potential was due to the doping of the K element,
      which could reduce the band gap, increase the in-plane spacing, and expand
      pi-conjugated systems. Furthermore, using K-doped g-C3N4 with highly stable
      electrochemiluminescence at lower potential as an emitter, a biosensor for
      microRNA-141 (miRNA-141) sensitive detection was constructed with the assistance 
      of an innovative nicking enzyme-assisted strand displacement amplification
      (N-SDA). Compared to the traditional SDA, a nicking enzyme was introduced to
      obviously improve the utilization rate of the fuel chain and increase the number 
      of cycles, finally resulting in higher signal amplification efficiency.
      Therefore, the constructed biosensor showed excellent performance in the
      ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-141 with the limit of detection (LOD) being
      44.8 aM. This work gave a more effective means to obviously improve the ECL
      property of g-C3N4 caused by electrode passivation and provided a more efficient 
      and convenient detection method for biochemical analysis.

TI  - Segmentation of Organs and Tumor within Brain Magnetic Resonance Images Using
      K-Nearest Neighbor Classification.
PG  - 40-49
LID - 10.4103/jmp.jmp_87_21 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To fully exploit the benefits of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
      radiotherapy, it is desirable to develop segmentation methods to delineate
      patients' MRI images fast and accurately. The purpose of this work is to develop 
      a semi-automatic method to segment organs and tumor within the brain on standard 
      T1- and T2-weighted MRI images. Methods and Materials: Twelve brain cancer
      patients were retrospectively included in this study, and a simple rigid
      registration was used to align all the images to the same spatial coordinates.
      Regions of interest were created for organs and tumor segmentations. The
      K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm was used to characterize the
      knowledge of previous segmentations using 15 image features (T1 and T2 image
      intensity, 4 Gabor filtered images, 6 image gradients, and 3 Cartesian
      coordinates), and the trained models were used to predict organ and tumor
      contours. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), normalized surface dice,
      sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff distance were used to evaluate the
      performance of segmentations. Results: Our semi-automatic segmentations matched
      with the ground truths closely. The mean DSC value was between 0.49 (optical
      chiasm) and 0.89 (right eye) for organ segmentations and was 0.87 for tumor
      segmentation. Overall performance of our method is comparable or superior to the 
      previous work, and the accuracy of our semi-automatic segmentation is generally
      better for large volume objects. Conclusion: The proposed KNN method can
      accurately segment organs and tumor using standard brain MRI images, provides
      fast and accurate image processing and planning tools, and paves the way for
      clinical implementation of MRI-guided radiotherapy and adaptive radiotherapy.

AB  - Phytochemical investigation the resins of Ferula sinkiangensis K.M.Shen yielded
      three new tetrahydrobenzofuran derivatives named as Sinkiangensis A-C (1-3). The 
      structures of the new compounds were elucidated by analysis of their NMR, HRMS,
      and ECD spectra, and the absolute configurations were established through the
      comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Compound 3 exhibited
      moderate antitumor activities against AGS cancer cell with IC50 values of 15.6
      microM. Moreover, assays demonstrated that compound 3 could induce AGS cancer
      cell apoptosis.

TI  - The Immune System in Hypertension: a Lost Shaker of Salt 2021 Lewis K. Dahl
      Memorial Lecture.
PG  - 1339-1347
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.18554 [doi]
AB  - The seminal observations of Dr Lewis Dahl regarding renal mechanisms of
      hypertension remain highly relevant in light of more recent experiments showing
      that immune system dysfunction contributes to hypertension pathogenesis. Dr Dahl 
      established that inappropriate salt retention in the kidney plays a central role 
      via Ohm's Law in permitting blood pressure elevation. Nevertheless, inflammatory 
      cytokines whose expression is induced in the early stages of hypertension can
      alter renal blood flow and sodium transporter expression and activity to foster
      renal sodium retention. By elaborating these cytokines and reactive oxygen
      species, myeloid cells and T lymphocytes can connect systemic inflammatory
      signals to aberrant kidney functions that allow sustained hypertension. By
      activating T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells
      represent an afferent sensing mechanism triggering T cell activation, cytokine
      generation, and renal salt and water reabsorption. Manipulating these
      inflammatory signals to attenuate hypertension without causing prohibitive
      systemic immunosuppression will pose a challenge, but disrupting actions of
      inflammatory mediators locally within the kidney may offer a path through which
      to target immune-mediated mechanisms of hypertension while capitalizing on Dr
      Dahl's key recognition of the kidney's importance in blood pressure regulation.

AB  - This classic discusses the original publication "A method of resurfacing
      osteoarthritic knee joints" by Dr K.H. Pridie (1959), where this pioneer surgeon 
      described a newly developed method for the treatment of osteoarthritic joint
      surfaces of the knee, which he named subchondral drilling. This short and concise
      11-line publication appeared in the Proceedings of the Congress of the British
      Orthopaedic Association. It has generated 464 citations since 1959, becoming part
      of the hundred most-cited publications in knee research. Pridie introduced in
      clinical experimentation the entity of Marrow Stimulation Techniques to liberate 
      mesenchymal stem cells from cancellous bone. He was aware that the results
      induced, in terms of quality of the regrown tissue, was limited and "only"
      fibrocartilage. His idea might have been raised from the work of numerous animal 
      researchers who confirmed repeatedly since 1905 that cartilage needed an osseous 
      perforation to heal. Although the past 60 years brought modifications from the
      technique described in the original article, the concept of marrow stimulation
      introduced by Pridie remains the most frequently used in cartilage repair surgery
      today.

TI  - Recurrent Ischemic Stroke and Bleeding in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Who
      Suffered an Acute Stroke While on Treatment With Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral
      Anticoagulants: The RENO-EXTEND Study.
PG  - 2620-2627
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.038239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with atrial fibrillation who suffered an ischemic stroke 
      while on treatment with nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, rates and
      determinants of recurrent ischemic events and major bleedings remain uncertain.
      METHODS: This prospective multicenter observational study aimed to estimate the
      rates of ischemic and bleeding events and their determinants in the follow-up of 
      consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation who suffered an acute
      cerebrovascular ischemic event while on nonvitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulant treatment. Afterwards, we compared the estimated risks of ischemic 
      and bleeding events between the patients in whom anticoagulant therapy was
      changed to those who continued the original treatment. RESULTS: After a mean
      follow-up time of 15.0+/-10.9 months, 192 out of 1240 patients (15.5%) had 207
      ischemic or bleeding events corresponding to an annual rate of 13.4%. Among the
      events, 111 were ischemic strokes, 15 systemic embolisms, 24 intracranial
      bleedings, and 57 major extracranial bleedings. Predictive factors of recurrent
      ischemic events (strokes and systemic embolisms) included CHA2DS2-VASc score
      after the index event (odds ratio [OR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3] for each point
      increase; P=0.05) and hypertension (OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.0-5.1]; P=0.04).
      Predictive factors of bleeding events (intracranial and major extracranial
      bleedings) included age (OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.0-1.2] for each year increase;
      P=0.002), history of major bleeding (OR, 6.9 [95% CI, 3.4-14.2]; P=0.0001) and
      the concomitant administration of an antiplatelet agent (OR, 2.8 [95% CI,
      1.4-5.5]; P=0.003). Rates of ischemic and bleeding events were no different in
      patients who changed or not changed the original nonvitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulants treatment (OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.7]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      suffering a stroke despite being on nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant
      therapy are at high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and bleeding. In these
      patients, further research is needed to improve secondary prevention by
      investigating the mechanisms of recurrent ischemic stroke and bleeding.

AB  - We encountered an 11-day-old male neonate with vitamin K deficiency-induced
      intracranial hemorrhage, despite receiving oral vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4)
      prophylaxis according to Japanese guidelines. This case suggests that the current
      vitamin K deficiency-bleeding prophylaxis programs cannot prevent bleeding
      completely. Better prophylaxis programs using both intramuscular and oral
      administration should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, acetabular posterior wall fracture combined
      with femoral head fracture is rare. However, with the increasing number of
      engineering and traffic accidents, such fractures, have increased significantly
      in recent years. This paper aims to explore the clinical efficiency of the
      Kocher-Langenbeck (K-L) and Smith-Petersen (S-P) combined approaches for open
      reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of acetabular posterior wall fractures
      accompanied by femoral head fractures (Pipkin type IV fractures). METHODS: A
      retrospective study was conducted on 8 patients who underwent open reduction and 
      internal fixation (ORIF) of Pipkin type IV fractures through the K-L combined
      with S-P approach in our hospital from January 2015 to January 2020. All 8
      patients were successfully operated on without serious complications, such as
      important blood vessel and nerve damage, with an operation time of 143.8 +/-
      44.38 min and intraoperative blood loss of 225 +/- 70.71 ml. Perioperative data
      were recorded. The Harris score was used to evaluate the clinical effect.
      Fracture reduction quality was evaluated according to the Matta radiological
      standard. The grade of ectopic ossification was evaluated by the Brooker grading 
      method, and the stage of femoral head necrosis was evaluated by Ficat-Arlet
      staging. RESULTS: The Harris score increased significantly from 57.38 +/- 4.779
      at 3 months, to 76.13 +/- 3.682 at 6 months, 88.25 +/- 3.495 at 12 months, and
      92.13 +/- 2.232 at 36 months postoperatively. After statistical analysis,
      compared with the previous observation time point, the data comparison
      differences between the groups were statistically significant. P < 0.001, P <
      0.001, P < 0.05). By the time of the latest follow-up, 6 of the 8 patients had
      recovered to the level of pre-injury sports capacity. In contrast, the other 2
      patients remained below the level of pre-injury sports capacity. In terms of
      imaging evaluation, the quality of fracture reduction on radiographs was graded
      as excellent in 6 patients and good in 2 patients according to Matta's criteria. 
      At the last follow-up, no heterotopic ossification or femoral head necrosis was
      found in of all the images. In addition, the hip joint space was normal in 6
      cases, mildly narrowed in 1 case, and clearly narrowed in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS:
      The K-L combined with S-P approach provides effective exposure for the reduction 
      and fixation of Pipkin type IV fractures and achieves satisfactory clinical
      outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that in patients treated with vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) is lower in females than
      in males. This retrospective study has evaluated a possible association among
      over-anticoagulation and gender, type and indications to VKAs, TTR and bleeding. 
      Moreover, the decrease of the INR level, after VKAs withdrawal, was considered.
      METHODS: From December 2020 to January 2004, 1230 patients with venous
      thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation were enrolled. Age, gender, type of VKAs, 
      clinical indications, INR values and bleeding events were recorded. TTR was
      calculated considering the entire period of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1616
      and 1759 over-anticoagulation episodes were found in males and females,
      respectively. The median INR value was 4.5 (4.0-19.04). Thirty-two percent of the
      patients did not have an overdose throughout the observation period. The median
      number of over-anticoagulation per year was significantly higher in females
      (0.39-year) than in males (0.28-year). After 24 h of VKAs withdrawal, INRs were
      similar in both genders. Logistic regression analysis showed that the episodes of
      over-anticoagulation per year were associated with females, atrial fibrillation, 
      warfarin therapy, follow-up length longer than 4 years, and TTR <73%, but were
      not associated to bleeding episodes. CONCLUSION: The higher number of
      over-anticoagulation can explain the lower TTR in females. An excess of
      anticoagulation is not associated with bleeding events. The recovery of INR
      performs better when acenocoumarol is used, therefore, in patients who present
      several episodes of over-anticoagulation, acenocumarolo could replace warfarin.

AB  - In turfgrass breeding, competent grass ecotypes are preferably identified for
      their resistance to salinity condition. This research was designed to explore
      genes that induce salt resistance (NHX1, NHX2, HKT1;4, SnRK2.4 and NAC9) and
      their role in physiological modifications of six tall wheatgrass ecotypes
      (Agropyron elongatum L.). The sites of sample collection were characterized by
      different levels of salinity, i.e. low (EC: 4 dS m(-1) and pH: 6.5), moderate
      (EC: 7 dS m(-1) and pH: 6.5) and high (EC: 12 dS m(-1) and pH: 7.5). This study
      was designed as a split-plot in a randomized complete block where salinity
      treatments served as the whole-plot factor and ecotypes served as the subplot
      factor. The ecotypes were screened for their resistance to salinity, based on
      visual symptoms, salt injury index, physiological features and biochemical
      parameters. The results revealed that ecotype 'AE5' was most resistant to
      salinity than other ecotypes, whereas 'AE3' was the most susceptible. To
      understand why these differences occurred, measurements were aimed at revealing
      mRNA levels that resulted from genes responsible for salt resistance. Our results
      demonstrated that salinity-resistant ecotypes showed high expression levels of
      several genes, i.e. NHX1, NHX2, HKT1;4, SnRK2.4 and NAC9 in the leaves and roots.
      These results were corroborated by a decrease (by 1.5-2.5 times) in stress
      markers, namely, superoxide anion (O2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and
      malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as an increase (by 0.5-7 times) in enzymatic and
      non-enzymatic antioxidant activity in salinity-resistant ecotypes when the plants
      were exposed to salinity. We observed higher values of initial root length and
      lateral root density (21% and 18%, respectively) in salinity-resistant ecotypes
      under salinity condition, compared to other ecotypes. There were lower expression
      levels of NHX1 and NHX2 in the roots, which were 3.2 and 2.1 times less,
      respectively, compared to the leaves. This implied that NHX1 and NHX2 expressions
      can lead to the sequestration of Na(+) in the leaves during salinity condition.
      The current research revealed that HKT1;4 was more able to restrict Na (+)
      accumulation, compared to the actions of NHX1 and NHX2 genes. The over-expression
      of HKT1;4 in 'AE5' allowed a better maintenance of root growth during salinity
      condition. The expression of NAC9 had an increase of 2.1-fold which correlated
      with an increase in the amount of antioxidant enzymes. In general, the location
      of sample collection explained the differences in gene expression, especially
      regarding the extent to which plants respond to salinity condition. Ultimately,
      these differences can define physiological features in salinity-resistant and
      salinity-susceptible ecotypes of tall wheatgrass.

AB  - In this article, a distributed and time-delayed k-winner-take-all (DT-kWTA)
      network is established and analyzed for competitively coordinated task assignment
      of a multirobot system. It is considered and designed from the following three
      aspects. First, a network is built based on a k-winner-take-all (kWTA)
      competitive algorithm that selects k maximum values from the inputs. Second, a
      distributed control strategy is used to improve the network in terms of
      communication load and computational burden. Third, the time-delayed problem
      prevalent in arbitrary causal systems (especially, in networks) is taken into
      account in the proposed network. This work combines distributed kWTA competition 
      network with time delay for the first time, thus enabling it to better handle
      realistic applications than previous work. In addition, it theoretically derives 
      the maximum delay allowed by the network and proves the convergence and
      robustness of the network. The results are applied to a multirobot system to
      conduct its robots' competitive coordination to complete the given task.

AB  - Urinary tract infections are the most common complication in kidney transplant
      recipients, possibly resulting in the deterioration of a long-term kidney
      allograft function and an increased risk of recipient's death. K. pneumoniae has 
      emerged as one of the most prevalent etiologic agents in the context of recurrent
      urinary tract infections, especially with multidrug resistant strains. This paper
      discusses the epidemiology and risk factors associated with urinary tract
      infections in kidney transplant recipients, multi-drug resistance of K.
      pneumoniae (ESBL, KPC, NDM), treatment and pathogenesis of K. pneumoniae
      infections, and possible causes of recurrent UTIs. It also addresses the issue of
      colonization/becoming a carrier of K. pneumoniae in the gastrointestinal tract
      and asymptomatic bacteriuria in relation to a symptomatic UTI development and
      epidemiology.

TI  - Effects of ginsenoside compound K on colitis-associated colorectal cancer and gut
      microbiota profiles in mice.
PG  - 408
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-793 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ginsenoside compound K (GC-K), generated from ginseng saponins
      bioconverted by gut microbiota, has potential anti-colorectal cancer (CRC)
      effects. Meanwhile, GC-K may interact with gut microbiota, playing important
      roles in the occurrence and development of CRC. However, the effects of gut
      microbiota on the preventive and therapeutic effects of GC-K in CRC remain to be 
      elucidated. Methods: The anti-CRC effects of GC-K were evaluated in an
      azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated CRC
      Balb/c mice model under the dosage of 30 and 60 mg/kg. Stool samples were
      collected during the experiments for profiling gut microbiota by 16S rRNA
      sequencing. Correlative analysis between gut microbiota and anti-CRC effect of
      GC-K was also assessed. Finally, the anti-CRC effect of Akkermansia muciniphila
      (A. muciniphila) was validated in CRC cell lines. Results: GC-K could
      significantly suppress tumor growth in vivo at the dosage of 60 mg/kg without
      exogenous interference of gut microbiota. Moreover, dysbiosis of gut microbiota
      was observed in the CRC model group, which could be recovered by GC-K treatment. 
      In particular, A. muciniphila, which could inhibit the proliferation of HCT-116, 
      HT-29, and LOVO cells, was significantly up-regulated by GC-K. Conclusions: GC-K 
      was verified to suppress the tumor growth of AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated
      CRC through the modulation of gut microbiota, partially by up-regulation of A.
      muciniphila.

TI  - Biglycan as a potential regulator of tumorgenicity and immunogenicity in
      K-RAS-transformed cells.
PG  - 2069214
LID - 10.1080/2162402X.2022.2069214 [doi]
AB  - The extracellular matrix component biglycan (BGN) plays an essential role in
      various physiological and pathophysiological processes. A deficient BGN
      expression associated with reduced immunogenicity was found in
      HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. To determine whether BGN is suppressed by
      oncogene-driven regulatory networks, the expression and function of BGN was
      analyzed in murine and human BGN(low)/BGN(high) K-RAS(G12V)-transformed model
      systems as well as in different patients' datasets of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) 
      lesions. K-RAS-mutated CRC tissues expressed low BGN mRNA and protein levels when
      compared to normal colon epithelial cells, which was associated with a reduced
      patients' survival. Transfection of BGN in murine and human BGN(low)
      K-RAS-expressing cells resulted in a reduced growth and migration of BGN(high) vs
      BGN(low) K-RAS cells. In addition, increased MHC class I surface antigens as a
      consequence of an enhanced antigen processing machinery component expression was 
      found upon restoration of BGN, which was confirmed by RNA-sequencing of BGN(low) 
      vs. BGN(high) K-RAS models. Furthermore, a reduced tumor formation of BGN(high)
      versus BGN(low) K-RAS-transformed fibroblasts associated with an enhanced MHC
      class I expression and an increased frequency of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      in tumor lesions was found. Our data provide for the first time an inverse link
      between BGN and K-RAS expression in murine and human K-RAS-overexpressing models 
      and CRC lesions associated with altered growth properties, reduced immunogenicity
      and worse patients' outcome. Therefore, reversion of BGN might be a novel
      therapeutic option for K-RAS-associated malignancies.

TI  - Electricity consumption variation of public buildings in response to COVID-19
      restriction and easing policies: A case study in Scotland, U.K.
PG  - 112149
LID - 10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112149 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of studies have showed energy demand changes during COVID-19;
      this study aims to further disclose the impact of the restriction and easing
      policies on the energy consumption of public buildings where occupants' usage and
      activities are regulated in response to the pandemic. This study analyzes
      half-hourly electricity consumption data of 35 public buildings covering 6
      building types in the Perth and Kinross Council area in Scotland, U.K., over the 
      span of 2020 and 2021. The results show that the restriction has a greater impact
      on the electricity reduction in the first year of the pandemic than that in the
      second year. In response to the restriction, the electricity use intensity of all
      public buildings reduces significantly (p < 0.001) except office buildings with
      no significant reduction (p > 0.05); secondary schools have the highest
      electricity consumption reduction (275.04 kwh/day), while museums have the lowest
      reduction (58.62 kwh/day). In addition, the electricity consumption and
      electricity use intensity of museum, library and school buildings are inversely
      proportional to the restriction intensity, while this is opposite for office
      buildings. Combing restriction intensity and mobility data, this research reveals
      the different impacts of the restriction policies on the electricity consumption 
      of public buildings during the pandemic, which reflects people's changing
      attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19. The results provide a reference basis
      for energy management to develop more realistic energy demand policies based on
      public building types and to optimize the electricity supply load and energy
      profile during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Data Set-Adaptive Minimizer Order Reduces Memory Usage in k-Mer Counting.
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2021.0599 [doi]
AB  - The rapid continuous growth of deep sequencing experiments requires development
      and improvement of many bioinformatic applications for analysis of large
      sequencing data sets, including k-mer counting and assembly. Several applications
      reduce memory usage by binning sequences. Binning is done by using minimizer
      schemes, which rely on a specific order of the minimizers. It has been
      demonstrated that the choice of the order has a major impact on the performance
      of the applications. Here we introduce a method for tailoring the order to the
      data set. Our method repeatedly samples the data set and modifies the order so as
      to flatten the k-mer load distribution across minimizers. We integrated our
      method into Gerbil, a state-of-the-art memory-efficient k-mer counter, and were
      able to reduce its memory footprint by 30%-50% for large k, with only a minor
      increase in runtime. Our tests also showed that the orders produced by our method
      produced superior results when transferred across data sets from the same
      species, with little or no order change. This enables memory reduction with
      essentially no increase in runtime.

TI  - Quantum computational study of chloride attack on chloromethane for chemical
      accuracy and quantum noise effects with UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD ansatzes.
PG  - 7495
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11537-6 [doi]
AB  - Quantum computing is expected to play an important role in solving the problem of
      huge computational costs in various applications by utilizing the collective
      properties of quantum states, including superposition, interference, and
      entanglement, to perform computations. Quantum mechanical (QM) methods are
      candidates for various applications and can provide accurate absolute energy
      calculations in structure-based methods. QM methods are powerful tools for
      describing reaction pathways and their potential energy surfaces (PES). In this
      study, we applied quantum computing to describe the PES of the bimolecular
      nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction between chloromethane and chloride ions.
      We performed noiseless and noise simulations using quantum algorithms and
      compared the accuracy and noise effects of the ansatzes. In noiseless
      simulations, the results from UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD are similar to those of full
      configurational interaction (FCI) with the same active space, which indicates
      that quantum algorithms can describe the PES of the SN2 reaction. In noise
      simulations, UCCSD is more susceptible to quantum noise than k-UpCCGSD.
      Therefore, k-UpCCGSD can serve as an alternative to UCCSD to reduce quantum noisy
      effects in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and k-UpCCGSD is sufficient 
      to describe the PES of the SN2 reaction in this work. The results showed the
      applicability of quantum computing to the SN2 reaction pathway and provided
      valuable information for structure-based molecular simulations with quantum
      computing.

TI  - First Report of Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde causing
      anthracnose disease in Santalum album Linn. in India.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-22-0708-PDN [doi]
AB  - Indian sandalwood (Santalum album), valued for its medicinal properties, is an
      indigenous species of India. Circular or irregular pale yellow lesions surrounded
      by a purple halo with prominent pinhead sized black fruiting bodies at the centre
      of the lesion were observed on leaves of sandalwood seedlings in a nursery
      located in Karnataka, with a disease incidence of 75% (n = 100 investigated
      plants) during July 2020. The disease prevailed in monsoon followed by winter
      season (July 2020 - January 2021); summer was less supportive for the disease
      incidence. As the disease progressed, lesions expanded and merged, causing
      necrosis of the whole leaf. Isolation of the pathogen involved excision of small 
      sections of diseased tissues from the lesions followed by surface sterilization
      with 70% ethanol for 30 s and in 1% NaClO for 1 min. Sections were rinsed in
      sterile distilled water, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at
      25 degrees C for 7 days. Ten isolates of Colletotrichum ssp. were obtained with
      an isolation frequency = 10/12x100 = 83%. One representative single-spore isolate
      (CSSA-1) was used for further study. Initially, pure cultures exhibited a white
      mycelium which later turned gray with time, and had orange conidial masses in a
      concentric ring pattern with the aggregation of black acervuli at the center of
      the culture Conidia were single celled, hyaline, and cylindrical having smooth
      rounded ends and the size ranged from 12.6 to 18.5 microm in length, and 3.5 to
      5.6 microm in width (n = 100). The morphological characteristics were in
      agreement with the species description of fungi in the Colletotrichum
      gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). To confirm the species
      designation of the isolate CSSA-1, a multilocus phylogenetic analysis was
      performed using six genomic loci (Weir et al. 2012; Marin-Felix et al. 2017). The
      internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and a partial sequence of the
      beta-tubulin (TUB2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin
      synthase 1 (CHS-1), actin (ACT), and glutamine synthetase (GS) genes were
      amplified using ITS1/ITS4, BT2F/BT4R, GAPDHF/R, 79F/354R, 512F/783R and GSF/GSR
      primers, respectively. The ITS (OK254122), TUB2 (OL462863), GAPDH (OL462859),
      CHS-1 (OL462860), actin (OL462861), and glutamine synthetase (OL961822) sequences
      of representative isolate CSSA-1 showed 99 to 100% identity with sequences
      MZ148628, MK967339, MN525882, MW192791, MT263504, MF111030, MH370542 and
      KX578767, respectively to the holotype isolate of Colletotrichum siamense
      (Prihastuti et al. 2009). The sequences were analysed with representative
      sequences of Colletotrichum and a multilocus Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree
      with ITS-GAPDH-ACT-CHS1-GS-TUB2 concatenated data sets (concatenated with
      Sequence Matrix v.1.8 (Vaidya et al. 2011)) was constructed using Beast version
      1.8.4 to confirm the isolate identification (Drummond et al. 2012; Hyde et al.
      2014; Weir et al. 2012). Isolate CSSA-1 clustered with C. siamense isolates. To
      complete Koch's postulates, for the characterized isolate CSSA-1, a pathogenicity
      test was conducted on 3-month-old sandalwood seedlings by spore spray
      inoculation. Ten plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension (106
      conidia/ml) and control plants inoculated with sterilized water then kept in a
      glass house at 25 degrees C and >85% relative humidity with a 12-h photoperiod.
      Humidity was maintained by spraying the plants with water in the morning and
      evening to enhance the infection. Typical symptoms of anthracnose disease similar
      to naturally infected leaves were observed, which included circular pale yellow
      lesions surrounded by a purple halo with prominent pinhead sized black fruiting
      bodies at the center of the lesion 7 days after inoculation, while the control
      plants remained unaffected. The pathogen was reisolated from infected leaves and 
      its identity was confirmed as C. siamense based on morphological characteristics.
      Previously, C. siamense was identified causing disease on chili in India (Gunjan 
      and Shenoy, 2014), but to our knowledge this is the first report of leaf
      anthracnose caused by C. siamense on Indian sandalwood in India or globally. This
      study documents crucial information, paving way for epidemiologic studies and
      design of control strategies to combat this newly emerging disease.

TI  - Observation of Two New Excited Xi_{b}^{0} States Decaying to
      Lambda_{b}^{0}K^{-}pi^{+}.
PG  - 162001
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.162001 [doi]
AB  - Two narrow resonant states are observed in the Lambda_{b}^{0}K^{-}pi^{+} mass
      spectrum using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
      energy of 13 TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment and corresponding to an
      integrated luminosity of 6 fb^{-1}. The minimal quark content of the
      Lambda_{b}^{0}K^{-}pi^{+} system indicates that these are excited Xi_{b}^{0}
      baryons. The masses of the Xi_{b}(6327)^{0} and Xi_{b}(6333)^{0} states are
      m[Xi_{b}(6327)^{0}]=6327.28_{-0.21}^{+0.23}+/-0.12+/-0.24 and
      m[Xi_{b}(6333)^{0}]=6332.69_{-0.18}^{+0.17}+/-0.03+/-0.22 MeV, respectively, with
      a mass splitting of Deltam=5.41_{-0.27}^{+0.26}+/-0.12 MeV, where the
      uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and due to the Lambda_{b}^{0} mass
      measurement. The measured natural widths of these states are consistent with
      zero, with upper limits of Gamma[Xi_{b}(6327)^{0}]<2.20(2.56) and
      Gamma[Xi_{b}(6333)^{0}]<1.60(1.92) MeV at a 90% (95%) credibility level. The
      significance of the two-peak hypothesis is larger than nine (five) Gaussian
      standard deviations compared to the no-peak (one-peak) hypothesis. The masses,
      widths, and resonant structure of the new states are in good agreement with the
      expectations for a doublet of 1D Xi_{b}^{0} resonances.

TI  - High-Temperature Superconducting Phase in Clathrate Calcium Hydride CaH_{6} up to
      215 K at a Pressure of 172 GPa.
PG  - 167001
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.167001 [doi]
AB  - The recent discovery of superconductive rare earth and actinide superhydrides has
      ushered in a new era of superconductivity research at high pressures. This
      distinct type of clathrate metal hydrides was first proposed for
      alkaline-earth-metal hydride CaH_{6} that, however, has long eluded experimental 
      synthesis, impeding an understanding of pertinent physics. Here, we report
      successful synthesis of CaH_{6} and its measured superconducting critical
      temperature T_{c} of 215 K at 172 GPa, which is evidenced by a sharp drop of
      resistivity to zero and a characteristic decrease of T_{c} under a magnetic field
      up to 9 T. An estimate based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model gives a
      giant zero-temperature upper critical magnetic field of 203 T. These remarkable
      benchmark superconducting properties place CaH_{6} among the most outstanding
      high-T_{c} superhydrides, marking it as the hitherto only clathrate metal hydride
      outside the family of rare earth and actinide hydrides. This exceptional case
      raises great prospects of expanding the extraordinary class of high-T_{c}
      superhydrides to a broader variety of compounds that possess more diverse
      material features and physics characteristics.

      exposure to organic dust (OD) and various gases. Previously, we demonstrated that
      pre-exposure to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) alters the host response to OD and induces
      oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a master-regulator of host antioxidant response and
      exposures to toxicants is known to reduce Nrf2 activity. The OD exposure-induced 
      lung inflammation is known to increase susceptibility to a secondary microbial
      infection. We tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure to OD or H2S leads to 
      loss of Nrf2, loss of epithelial cell integrity and that activation of Nrf2
      rescues this epithelial barrier dysfunction. Primary normal human bronchial
      epithelial (NHBE) cells or mouse precision cut-lung slices (PCLS) were treated
      with media, swine confinement facility organic dust extract (ODE) or H2S or
      ODE+H2S for one or five days. Cells were also pretreated with vehicle control
      (DMSO) or RTA-408, a Nrf2 activator. Acute exposure to H2S and ODE+H2S altered
      the cell morphology, decreased the viability as per the MTT assay, and reduced
      the Nrf2 expression as well as increased the keap1 levels in NHBE cells. Repeated
      exposure to ODE or H2S or ODE+H2S induced oxidative stress and cytokine
      production, decreased tight junction protein occludin and cytoskeletal protein
      ezrin expression, disrupted epithelial integrity and resulted in increased
      Klebsiella pneumoniae invasion. RTA-408 (pharmacological activator of Nrf2)
      activated Nrf2 by decreasing keap1 levels and reduced ODE+H2S-induced changes
      including reversing loss of barrier integrity, inflammatory cytokine production
      and microbial invasion in PCLS but not in NHBE cell model. We conclude that Nrf2 
      activation has a partial protective function against ODE and H2S.

AB  - Polyploidization plays a critical role in producing new gene functions and
      promoting species evolution. Effective identification of polyploid types can be
      helpful in exploring the evolutionary mechanism. However, current methods for
      detecting polyploid types have some major limitations, such as being
      time-consuming and strong subjectivity, etc. In order to objectively and
      scientifically recognize collinearity fragments and polyploid types, we developed
      PolyReco method, which can automatically label collinear regions and recognize
      polyploidy events based on the K S dotplot. Combining with whole-genome
      collinearity analysis, PolyReco uses DBSCAN clustering method to cluster K S
      dots. According to the distance information in the x-axis and y-axis directions
      between the categories, the clustering results are merged based on certain rules 
      to obtain the collinear regions, automatically recognize and label collinear
      fragments. According to the information of the labeled collinear regions on the
      y-axis, the polyploidization recognition algorithm is used to exhaustively
      combine and obtain the genetic collinearity evaluation index of each combination,
      and then draw the genetic collinearity evaluation index graph. Based on the
      inflection point on the graph, polyploid types and related chromosomes with
      polyploidy signal can be detected. The validation experiments showed that the
      conclusions of PolyReco were consistent with the previous study, which verified
      the effectiveness of this method. It is expected that this approach can become a 
      reference architecture for other polyploid types classification methods.

AB  - Hereditary combined vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency (VKCFD) is a
      rare autosomal recessive congenital bleeding disorder. There are no established
      guidelines for the care for pregnant women and newborns within the context of
      VKCFD. A 39-year-old multigravida woman with a family history of VKCFD was
      referred for high-risk maternal fetal medicine care. Prenatal testing for fetal
      VKCFD was declined. The patient received vitamin K1 from 36 weeks of gestation
      and had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The baby had normal head ultrasound
      results, vital signs, and physical examination, with no signs of bleeding: factor
      levels and coagulation factors were within reference range. Follow-up showed no
      evidence of VKCFD. A thorough care plan is required for pregnant women whose
      newborns are at risk for VKCFD.

      case report.
PG  - 2269-2272
LID - 10.1016/j.radcr.2022.03.099 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are recommended in patients with mechanical heart
      valves. Major bleeding events remain the most life-threatening complication of
      this therapy and sometimes it can occur in unusual anatomic areas. Spontaneous
      retroperitoneal hematoma is one of the rare complications of anticoagulation
      therapy, which needs to be recognized early and managed promptly. Here, we report
      a case of a 40-year-old woman with mechanical heart valve treated with
      acenocoumarol, who was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain
      and whose investigations came back in favor of a massive retroperitoneal
      hematoma. The patient was successfully treated through conservative management
      resulting in a good outcome. Clinicians should be careful when prescribing VKA
      and should always think of retroperitoneal bleeding in the event of abdominal
      pain or a sudden decrease in the hemoglobin levels of anticoagulated patients.

TI  - Prospective Comparison of the Early Outcomes of Headless Compression Screw and

LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2022.02.010 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The study aimed to assess early clinical outcomes achieved by headless
      compression screws (HCS) in fixation of metacarpal fractures, and to compare them
      with outcomes of percutaneous K-wire fixation. The hypothesis was that HCS would 
      show better arc of motion and superior early clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was
      a randomized study of nonthumb metacarpal neck and shaft fractures. To compare
      the 2 surgical techniques, 23 patients treated for metacarpal neck and shaft
      fractures were divided into 2 groups: 11 treated with K-wire fixation and the
      other 12 with HCS fixation. We followed the patients for 12 weeks. The primary
      objective was to compare metacarpophalangeal arc of motion, and the secondary aim
      was to determine clinical union, radiographic union, and recovery time before
      returning to employment in the 2 groups. RESULTS: At each follow-up visit,
      patients in the group treated with HCS had better metacarpophalangeal arc of
      motion than those treated with K-wire fixation. The HCS group showed a shorter
      time interval to return to work (at 3 weeks) and no complications, while the
      K-wire group had 1 pin track infection, which was treated with oral antibiotics
      and pin removal. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with K-wire fixation, limited-open HCS
      fixation for metacarpal neck and shaft fractures was superior in terms of the
      early postoperative metacarpophalangeal arc of motion and return to work. TYPE OF
      STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.

AB  - To compare the predictive refractive accuracy of intraoperative aberrometry (ORA)
      to the preoperative Barrett True-K formula in the calculation of intraocular lens
      (IOL) power in eyes with prior refractive surgery undergoing cataract surgery at 
      the Loma Linda University Eye Institute, Loma Linda, California, USA. We
      conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a history of post-myopic 
      or hyperopic LASIK/PRK who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery between
      October 2016 and March 2020. Pre-operative measurements were performed utilizing 
      the Barrett True-K formula. Intraoperative aberrometry (ORA) was used for aphakic
      refraction and IOL power calculation during surgery. Predictive refractive
      accuracy of the two methods was compared based on the difference between achieved
      and intended target spherical equivalent. A total of 97 eyes (69 patients) were
      included in the study. Of these, 81 eyes (83.5%) had previous myopic LASIK/PRK
      and 16 eyes (16.5%) had previous hyperopic LASIK/PRK. Median (MedAE)/mean (MAE)
      absolute prediction errors for preoperative as compared to intraoperative methods
      were 0.49 D/0.58 D compared to 0.42 D/0.51 D, respectively (P = 0.001/0.002).
      Over all, ORA led to a statistically significant lower median and mean absolute
      error compared to the Barrett True-K formula in post-refractive eyes. Percentage 
      of eyes within +/- 1.00 D of intended target refraction as predicted by the
      preoperative versus the intraoperative method was 82.3% and 89.6%, respectively
      (P = 0.04). Although ORA led to a statistically significant lower median absolute
      error compared to the Barrett True-K formula, the two methods are clinically
      comparable in predictive refractive accuracy in patients with prior refractive
      surgery.

AB  - The rapid popularization of high-speed mobile communication technology and the
      continuous development of mobile network devices have given spatial textual big
      data (STBD) new dimensions due to their ability to record geographical objects
      from multiple sources and with complex attributes. Data mining from spatial
      textual datasets has become a meaningful study. As a popular topic for STBD, the 
      top-k spatial keyword query has been developed in various forms to deal with
      different retrievals requirements. However, previous research focused mainly on
      indexing locational attributes and retrievals of few target attributes, and these
      correlations between large numbers of the textual attributes have not been fully 
      studied and demonstrated. To further explore interrelated-knowledge in the
      textual attributes, this paper defines the top-k frequent spatial keyword query
      (tfSKQ) and proposes a novel hybrid index structure, named RCL-tree, based on the
      concept lattice theory. We also develop the tfSKQ algorithms to retrieve the most
      frequent and nearest spatial objects in STBD. One existing method and two
      baseline algorithms are implemented, and a series of experiments are carried out 
      using real datasets to evaluate its performance. Results demonstrated the
      effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RCL-tree in tfSKQ with the complex
      spatial multi keyword query conditions.

TI  - Prevalence of Rh and K phenotypes among blood donors from different ethnicities
      in Samtah (Southwestern Region) Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 202-208
LID - 10.1111/iji.12577 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rh and Kell blood group systems are amongst the most important
      blood group systems; being highly immunogenic after ABO system. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the frequencies of Rh antigens, haplotypes and K antigen
      among blood donors belonging to various ethnicities in Samtah, Jazan, Saudi
      Arabia. METHODS: This study was conducted during January 2019 and August 2020 at 
      Samtah General Hospital, Samtah. Records of all blood donors recruited during
      this period were included for data acquisition. A total of 4977 blood donors'
      records were reviewed and data were analysed. A total of 3863 donors' results
      were considered in the final analysis. RESULTS: In comparison to Saudi blood
      donors, C antigen was less frequent in Sudanese donors (69.7% and 34.0%), the c
      antigen was less frequent in Indian (79.2% and 59.3%) and Philippine (79.2% and
      40.0%) donors and more frequent in Sudanese (79.2% and 97.9%) donors, the E
      antigen was less frequent in Yemini (27.0% and 19.5%) and the e antigen was more 
      frequent in Yemini (96.7% and 99.2%) donors. The DcE haplotype was less frequent 
      (3.1% and 0.7%) and the ce haplotype was more frequent (4.3% and 7.6%) in Yemini 
      donors. The K antigen was less frequent in Pakistani (11.9% and 4.1%; p = .041)
      and Indian (11.9% and 1.9%; p = .023) donors. CONCLUSION: Rh and K antigens
      showed marked variations in their frequencies among blood donors of different
      ethnicities. Utilization of blood from various ethnicities warrant extended
      phenotyping of Rh and K antigens to avoid the risk of alloimmunization in
      multiply transfused patients.

AB  - Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is a photoelectrode for the water splitting process
      because of its relatively narrow bandgap and abundance in the earth's crust. In
      this study, the photoexcited state of a hematite thin film was investigated with 
      femtosecond oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the PAL-XFEL in 
      order to follow the dynamics of its photoexcited states. The 200 fs decay time of
      the hole state in the valence band was observed via its corresponding XAS
      feature.

      genotyping (HPV16/18), cytology (LBC), and p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology (DS) for
      the triage of high-risk Human Papillomavirus-positive (Hr-HPV+) women within the 
      cervical screening program in Scotland. METHODS: Data were derived from a cohort 
      of Hr-HPV+ women (n = 385) who participated in PaVDaG (Papillomavirus Dumfries
      and Galloway) study. Performance of triage strategies for detecting high-grade
      disease was assessed at 3 (in women <50 years) or 5 years (in women >50 years).
      Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and cNPV of each triage test were calculated for
      CIN2+ and CIN3+ when used singly or sequentially. RESULTS: The sensitivity of LBC
      (>/= borderline), DS, and HPV 16/18 genotyping for the detection of CIN2+ was
      62.7% (50.7-73.3), 77.7% (63.1-83.7), and 62.7% (50.7-73.3) with corresponding
      cNPVs of 10.9%, 8.4%, and 11.9%. The option with the highest sensitivity and
      lowest cNPV was HPV 16/18 genotyping followed by LBC of Hr-HPV other+ and then DS
      of the LBC negatives. This yielded sensitivity of 94.7% (86.2-98.3) and cNPV 2.7%
      for CIN2+. Triage performance was similar if women had tested Hr-HPV+ positive by
      vaginal self-sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Two-step triage with HPV 16/18 genotyping
      before LBC (or DS) for Hr-HPV other+ women was associated with a lower risk of
      significant disease at follow-up compared with single triage approaches. IMPACT: 
      This study provides longitudinal performance data on triage strategies in Hr-HPV+
      women and will be informative for the evolution of cervical screening programs
      that increasingly rely on molecular technologies.

TI  - Cardiac glycosides stimulate endocytosis of GLUT1 via intracellular Na(+) ,K(+)
      -ATPase alpha3-isoform in human cancer cells.
PG  - 2980-2991
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30762 [doi]
AB  - Glucose transporter GLUT1 plays a primary role in the glucose metabolism of
      cancer cells. Here, we found that cardiac glycosides (CGs) such as ouabain,
      oleandrin, and digoxin, which are Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase inhibitors, decreased the
      GLUT1 expression in the plasma membrane of human cancer cells (liver cancer
      HepG2, colon cancer HT-29, gastric cancer MKN45, and oral cancer KB cells). The
      effective concentration of ouabain was lower than that for inhibiting the
      activity of Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase alpha1-isoform (alpha1NaK) in the plasma
      membrane. The CGs also inhibited [(3) H]2-deoxy- d-glucose uptake, lactate
      secretion, and proliferation of the cancer cells. In intracellular vesicles of
      human cancer cells, Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase alpha3-isoform (alpha3NaK) is abnormally 
      expressed. Here, a low concentration of ouabain inhibited the activity of
      alpha3NaK. Knockdown of alpha3NaK significantly inhibited the ouabain-decreased
      GLUT1 expression in HepG2 cells, while the alpha1NaK knockdown did not.
      Consistent with the results in human cancer cells, CGs had no effect on GLUT1
      expression in rat liver cancer dRLh-84 cells where alpha3NaK was not endogenously
      expressed. Interestingly, CGs decreased GLUT expression in the dRLh-84 cells
      exogenously expressing alpha3NaK. In HepG2 cells, alpha3NaK was found to be
      colocalized with TPC1, a Ca(2+) -releasing channel activated by nicotinic acid
      adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). The CGs-decreased GLUT1 expression was
      significantly inhibited by a Ca(2+) chelator, a Ca(2+) -ATPase inhibitor, and a
      NAADP antagonist. The GLUT1 decrease was also attenuated by inhibitors of dynamin
      and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks). In conclusion, the binding of CGs to 
      intracellular alpha3NaK elicits the NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization followed
      by the dynamin-dependent GLUT1 endocytosis in human cancer cells.

TI  - Inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related gene K+ currents expressed in HEK293
      cells by three gingerol components from ginger.
LID - rgac029 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jpp/rgac029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gingerols are bioactive compounds derived from ginger, our experiment
      investigates the effects of 6-, 8- and 10-Gin on the human ether-a-go-go-related 
      gene (hERG) K+ channels by using patch clamp technology. KEY FINDINGS: hERG K+
      currents were suppressed by 6-, 8- and 10-Gin in a concentration-dependent
      manner. The IC50 values of 6-, 8- and 10-Gin were 41.5, 16.1 and 86.5 muM for the
      hERG K+ currents, respectively. The maximum inhibitory effects caused by 6-, 8-
      and 10-Gin were 44.3% +/- 2.0%, 88.6% +/- 1.3% and 63.1% +/- 1.1%, respectively, 
      and the effects were almost completely reversible. CONCLUSION: These findings
      suggest that 8-Gin is the most potent hERG K+ channel inhibitor among gingerol
      components and may offer a new approach for understanding and treating cancer.

TI  - Dataset exploring organizational culture of K-12 schools.
PG  - 108179
LID - 10.1016/j.dib.2022.108179 [doi]
AB  - Culture can be understood as an explicit social product arising from social
      interaction as an intentional or unintentional consequence of behavior.
      Educational Institutions culture differs from other organizational cultures as it
      impacts teachers' performance and students' learning. In this survey the
      definition of organizational culture used is given by Schein, "The deeper level
      of basic assumptions and beliefs that are, learned responses to the group's
      problems of survival in its external environment and its problems of internal
      integration; are shared by members of an organization; that operate
      unconsciously; and that define in a basic 'taken -for-granted' fashion in an
      organization's view of itself and its environment" [1]. The data contains 1158
      cases collected from K-12 School teachers on their perception of values and
      beliefs of their organizational culture using the OCTAPACE scale. Convenience
      sampling is used to obtain the data from teachers. The questionnaire was
      administered personally to teachers from sixty-five Private aided, Private
      unaided and Government schools. The eight dimensions measuring values and beliefs
      of Educational Institutions organizational culture are Pro-action, Authenticity, 
      Openness, Collaboration, Experimenting, Trust, Confrontation and Autonomy.
      Descriptive statistics are computed from the dataset. The dataset can be used by 
      researchers for meta analysis on organizational culture and school management can
      explore in depth the need for an organizational culture of autonomy,
      experimenting, collaboration and openness among teachers.

TI  - The Relationship Among Intestinal Bacteria, Vitamin K and Response of Vitamin K
      Antagonist: A Review of Evidence and Potential Mechanism.
PG  - 829304
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.829304 [doi]
AB  - The vitamin K antagonist is a commonly prescribed effective oral anticoagulant
      with a narrow therapeutic range, and the dose requirements for different patients
      varied greatly. In recent years, studies on human intestinal microbiome have
      provided many valuable insights into disease development and drug reactions. A
      lot of studies indicated the potential relationship between microbiome and the
      vitamin K antagonist. Vitamin K is absorbed by the gut, and the intestinal
      bacteria are a major source of vitamin K in human body. A combined use of the
      vitamin K antagonist and antibiotics may result in an increase in INR, thus
      elevating the risk of bleeding, while vitamin K supplementation can improve
      stability of anticoagulation for oral vitamin K antagonist treatment. Recently,
      how intestinal bacteria affect the response of the vitamin K antagonist remains
      unclear. In this review, we reviewed the research, focusing on the physiology of 
      vitamin K in the anticoagulation treatment, and investigated the potential
      pathways of intestinal bacteria affecting the reaction of the vitamin K
      antagonist.

AB  - We develop and present a k-nearest neighbor space-time simulator that accounts
      for the spatiotemporal dependence in high-dimensional hydroclimatic fields (e.g.,
      wind and solar) and can simulate synthetic realizations of arbitrary length. We
      illustrate how this statistical simulation tool can be used in the context of
      regional power system planning under a scenario of high reliance on wind and
      solar generation and when long historical records of wind and solar power
      generation potential are not available. We show how our simulation model can be
      used to assess the probability distribution of the severity and duration of
      energy "droughts" at the network scale that need to be managed by long-duration
      storage or alternate energy sources. We present this estimation of supply-side
      shortages for the Texas Interconnection.

TI  - Exploring the Impact and Acceptance of Wearable Sensor Technology for Pre- and
      Postoperative Rehabilitation in Knee Replacement Patients: A U.K.-Based Pilot
      Study.

LID - 10.2106/JBJS.OA.21.00154 [doi]
AB  - Knee replacement operations are common, highly successful procedures that are
      increasing in frequency. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for
      innovative care pathways that reduce face-to-face appointments. We report on the 
      impact of introducing a wearable sensor for pre- and postoperative rehabilitation
      of 21 knee replacement patients at 2 hospitals in the U.K. Methods: The sensor
      (BPMpathway; 270 Vision) was provided during joint school prior to knee
      replacement and stayed with the patient until a maximum of 9 weeks post-surgery. 
      Participant progress and exercise were monitored remotely, with exercise regimens
      altered as required. Participants and clinicians could communicate remotely via
      the device. Results: The median range of motion during the first week
      post-surgery was 63 degrees (interquartile range [IQR] = 21 degrees ) and
      increased to 136 degrees (IQR = 16 degrees ) by week 7. The rate of participant
      compliance with exercises using the device was 32.3% for thrice-daily compliance 
      and 52.4% for once-daily compliance. The 2-way communication channel was well
      utilized by both participants and clinicians. We report a 35.7% reduction in
      face-to-face physiotherapy appointments compared with standard practice. Finally,
      >80% of users who completed the feedback questionnaire reported a positive
      experience using the device, finding it easy to understand and reporting that it 
      motivated them to perform their exercises. Conclusions: The use of BPMpathway was
      well received, effective, and reduced face-to-face physiotherapy appointments.
      Clinical Relevance: Remote monitoring can reduce the burden to the outpatient
      physiotherapy service by supporting the post-COVID-19 surgical service recovery
      plans of the National Health Service and allowing patients to recuperate at home.

TI  - Personalization in Australian K-12 classrooms: how might digital teaching and
      learning tools produce intangible consequences for teachers' workplace
      conditions?
PG  - 1-18

AB  - Recent negotiations of 'data' in schools place focus on student assessment and
      NAPLAN. However, with the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) underpinning
      educational technology, there is a need to shift focus towards the value of
      teachers' digital data. By doing so, the broader debate surrounding the
      implications of these technologies and rights within the classroom as a workplace
      becomes more apparent to practitioners and educational researchers. Drawing on
      the Australian Human Rights Commission's Human Rights and Technology final
      report, this conceptual paper focusses on teachers' rights alongside emerging
      technologies that use or provide predictive analytics or artificial intelligence,
      also called 'personalisation'. The lens of Postdigital positionality guides the
      discussion. Three potential consequences are presented as provocations: (1) What 
      might happen if emerging technology uses teachers' digital data that represent
      current societal inequality? (2) What might happen if insights provided by such
      technology are inaccurate, insufficient, or unrepresentative of our teachers? (3)
      What might happen if the design of the AI system itself is discriminatory? This
      conceptual paper argues for increased discourse about technologies that use or
      provide predictive analytics complemented by considering potential consequences
      associated with algorithmic bias.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Esophageal cancer, one of the most common cancers in the upper
      digestive tract and is one of the leading cancer-related mortality worldwide.
      Accumulating studies found that Ginsenoside compound K (CK) has significantly
      anti-tumor effects, especially in the suppression of proliferation, migration, as
      well as invasion in various human cancers. While the effects of Ginsenoside CK in
      esophageal cancer have not been well studied. In our present study, we aim to
      explore the functions and mechanisms of Ginsenoside CK in the progression of
      esophageal cancer cells (Eca109). METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound
      healing, transwell and flow cytometry assays were applied to analyze the effects 
      of Ginsenoside CK in the progression of Eca109 cell, western blot assay was used 
      to investigate the potential downstream signaling pathway after Ginsenoside CK
      treatment. RESULTS: Our study found that Ginsenoside CK can suppress cell
      proliferation, migration and invasion of Eca109 cell. Furthermore, the flow
      cytometry showed that Ginsenoside CK increased of apoptosis rates in Eca109 cell.
      The western blot results indicated that Ginsenoside CK decreased the expression
      of VEGF-A, P-Pi3k and P-Akt proteins. Moreover, the knockdown of VEGF-A gene
      could suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induce apoptosis in
      Eca109 cell, and the expression of P-Pi3k and P-Akt proteins were significantly
      downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Ginsenoside CK inhibits the
      proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced apoptosis of Eca109 cell by
      blocking VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K is involved in the formation of coronary artery
      calcification which is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease. This
      study aims to explore the association between coronary artery calcification score
      and serum concentrations of vitamin K1, menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7
      (MK-7) in middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 116
      patients who underwent CT coronary angiography were consecutively enrolled. Serum
      concentrations of vitamin K1, MK-4 and MK-7 were determined by high performance
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The relationships between
      coronary artery calcification score and serum vitamin K concentrations were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Significantly lower serum vitamin K1 concentration was found
      in the patients with CACS > 400, comparing with the other CACS categories,
      respectively. Log (CACS + 1) was significantly higher in MK-4 < 0.05 ng/ml group 
      compared with MK-4 >/= 0.05 ng/ml group [2.03(0.21, 2.58) vs 1.31(0.00, 2.19), P 
      < 0.05]. In subjects with established coronary calcification (defined as CACS >
      10), vitamin K1 was found to be an independent factor contributing to higher CACS
      (r = -0.288, P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, serum
      vitamin K1 and MK-4 concentrations were significantly lower in middle-aged and
      elderly cohorts with increasing calcification scores. The significant effect of
      vitamin K1 on CACS was only found in individuals who already had calcification.
      Whether the detection of circulating vitamin K in patients with preexisting
      coronary calcification could guide vitamin K supplementation needs further
      exploration.

      mechanisms and is far more complex than acute/momentary pain. Current
      therapeutics for chronic inflammatory pain are often not effective because the
      etiology responsible for the pain is not addressed by traditional pharmacological
      treatments. Cathepsin K is a cysteine protease that has mostly been studied in
      the context of bone and joint disorders. Previous work by others has shown that
      inhibition of cathepsin K activity reduces osteoarthritis-associated nociception 
      in joints. However, the role of cathepsin K in cutaneous inflammation is
      understudied. We assessed the effectiveness of genetic deletion or
      pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin K in male mice on the expression of
      nocifensive behaviors after formalin injection or mechanical and thermal
      hypersensitivity after injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the
      mouse hind paw. Our data demonstrate that cathepsin K knockout mice (Ctsk(-/-))
      have a reduction in nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test. In addition,
      Ctsk(-/-) do not develop mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA injection for up
      to 7 days. Moreover, we found that inhibition of cathepsin K reduced mechanical
      hypersensitivity after CFA injection and mRNA levels, protein levels, and
      cathepsin K activity levels were elevated after CFA injection. Based upon our
      data, cathepsin K is indicated to play a role in the expression of
      chemically-induced cutaneous hypersensitivity, as Ctsk(-/-) mice do not develop
      mechanical hypersensitivity and show a reduction in nocifensive behaviors.
      Further research is needed to determine whether attenuating cathepsin K activity 
      may generate a clinically relevant therapeutic.

AB  - Eleven undescribed limonoids, cipacinerasins A-K, involving of four diverse
      carbon skeletal types, along with fifteen known analogues, were isolated from the
      branches and leaves of Cipadessa baccifera. Within them, cipacinerasins A and B
      feature a rearranged tetrahydropyranyl ring B formed between C-8 and C-30, are
      unusual miscellaneous-type limonoids. Cipacinerasins E and F are rare
      trijugin-type limonoids, of which the D-ring delta-lactone is cleaved. Their
      structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data (HRESIMS,
      NMR, UV and IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and
      single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All compounds were evaluated in vitro 
      cytotoxicity against five human tumor cell lines (K562, HeLa, PC3, LN-Cap and
      Hell), and cipacinerasin E showed moderate antitumor activity with IC50 values
      ranging from 8.0 to 24.8 muM.

AB  - Educator sexual misconduct is a serious problem in the United States (U.S.), with
      a 2004 Department of Education report estimating that 9.6% of K-12 students in
      the U.S. had experienced either verbal, visual, or physical educator misconduct
      at some point during their school career. However, since that report almost 20
      years ago, there have been few large-scale studies examining the extent of the
      problem. As such, the current study, which uses a large sample from recent high
      school graduates in four U.S. states, offers updated data on the nature and scope
      of sexual misconduct in educational settings. Overall, 11.7% of the 6632
      participants reported having experienced at least one form of educator sexual
      misconduct during Grades K-12, with 11% reporting sexual comments and less than
      1% reporting other forms of sexual misconduct (e.g., receiving sexual
      photos/messages, being kissed, touched sexually, or engaging in sexual
      intercourse/oral sex). Those who reported misconduct showed significantly more
      difficulties in current psychosocial functioning than those who did not report
      educator misconduct. Academic teachers most often perpetrated the abuse (63%),
      followed by coaches and gym teachers (20%). Educators who engaged in sexual
      misconduct were primarily male (85%), whereas students who reported experiencing 
      educator misconduct were primarily female (72%). Rates of disclosure to
      authorities were very low (4%) and some sexual grooming behaviors like gift
      giving (12%) and showing special attention (29%) were reported. These findings
      will be discussed as they pertain to the prevention of sexual misconduct within
      educational settings.

AB  - Oil in Water (3:1) emulsions were prepared using potato proteins in the presence 
      or absence of 0.2% k-carrageenan at different pH conditions (3.0, 7.0, and 4.8). 
      These emulsions showed different droplet sizes, stability, appearance, and
      rheological properties. The best emulsion stability was achieved combining potato
      proteins and k-carrageenan at pH 3.0, where uniform and small oil droplets (30
      microm) were observed. The rheological properties of the emulsions were also
      different. The highest viscosity and G' were shown by the emulsion prepared with 
      the addition of k-carrageenan at pH 3.0, this being attributed to the onset of a 
      gel-like viscoelastic structure in these conditions. SDS-PAGE indicated that the 
      superior properties of the emulsion prepared with k-carrageenan at pH 3.0 can be 
      attributed to an electrostatic interaction between the positively charged potato 
      proteins and the anionic polysaccharide. This interaction allowed the formation
      of a strong molecular network able to stabilize the system.

TI  - Major Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Co-Medicated With Non-Vitamin
      K Oral Anticoagulants and Antipsychotics.

AB  - Major bleeding risks associated with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs)
      used with and without concurrent antipsychotics in patients with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation (AF) were assessed. A total of 98,863 patients with
      non-valvular AF receiving at least one NOAC prescription from Taiwan's National
      Health Insurance database were enrolled. Major bleeding was defined as a primary 
      diagnosis of intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhage or bleeding at other
      sites. The adjusted incidence rate difference (AIRD) per 1,000 person-years and
      adjusted rate ratio of major bleeding were estimated using Poisson regression and
      inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. A total of
      8,037 major bleeding events occurred during 705,521 person-quarters with NOAC
      prescriptions. Antipsychotics were used in 26.35% of NOAC-exposed patients.
      Compared to using NOAC alone, co-medication of either typical (AIRD: 79.18, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 70.63-87.72) or atypical (AIRD: 40.5, 95% CI:
      33.64-47.35) antipsychotic with NOAC had a significant increase in the adjusted
      incidence rate per 1,000 person-years of major bleeding. The concomitant use of a
      NOAC with chlorpromazine (AIRD: 103.87, 95% CI: 51.22-156.52), haloperidol (AIRD:
      149.52, 95% CI: 125.03-174.00), prochlorperazine (AIRD: 90.43, 95% CI:
      78.55-102.32), quetiapine (AIRD: 44.6, 95% CI: 37.11-52.09), or risperidone
      (AIRD: 41.55, 95% CI: 22.86-60.24) (All p < 0.01) showed a higher adjusted
      incidence rate of major bleeding than using NOACs alone. The concomitant use of
      typical (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or prochlorperazine) or atypical
      (quetiapine or risperidone) antipsychotic with NOACs was associated with a
      significantly increased risk of major bleeding.

TI  - The effects of green waste compost on soil N, P, K, and organic matter fractions 
      in forestry soils: elemental analysis evaluation.
PG  - 31983-31991
LID - 10.1039/d1ra04986k [doi]
AB  - We study the effects of green waste compost on soil fertility to provide a
      theoretical basis for accurately improving forestry soil quality. This study aims
      to investigate the effects of green waste compost on soil N, P, K, and soil
      organic matter (SOM) fractions using elemental and FTIR analyses. Therefore, five
      fertilization treatments were set up for research, including mineral
      fertilization (M-fert), green waste compost fertilization (G-fert), standard rate
      of M-fert plus G-fert (GM-fert), half the standard rate of M-fert plus G-fert
      (1/2 GM-fert), and a control with no fertilizer addition (N-fert). The results
      showed that GM-fert treatment significantly increased the content of soil NH4-N, 
      available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), water soluble organic carbon
      (WSOC), humus (HE), and humic acid (HA), which were 8.53 +/- 0.67, 76.1 +/- 5.96,
      168 +/- 3.42, 0.152 +/- 0.01, 5.64 +/- 0.15, and 4.69 +/- 0.21 mg kg(-1),
      respectively. The content of HA (36.7%, F = 7.55, P = 0.01) was positively
      correlated with the soil N, P, K, and the HA absorption peak. The relative
      intensities of the alcohol -OH, aliphatic -CH and carbohydrate C-O peaks showed
      the largest changes, which were 18.6 +/- 0.56%, 13.1 +/- 0.33%, and 16.3 +/-
      0.49%. -CH/C[double bond, length as m-dash]C (49.8%, F = 12.9, P < 0.01) was also
      significantly positively correlated with soil N, P, K. In conclusion, green waste
      compost significantly increased soil N, P, K, and HA in forestry soils, and the
      -CH/C[double bond, length as m-dash]C of HA was the main factor related to soil
      nutrients.

      Depletion of Vitamin K-dependent Coagulation Factors: An Illustrative Case.
PG  - 63-67
LID - 10.2176/jns-nmc.2021-0295 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is
      believed to be associated with at least one known risk factor for ICH, such as
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, severe pneumonia, or
      anticoagulation therapy. However, in this study, we report a case of ICH in a
      14-year-old boy with mild COVID-19 infection without pneumonia who had no such
      risk factors. The only abnormal laboratory finding was temporary depletion of
      vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. This case indicates that COVID-19
      infection may cause simultaneous asymptomatic intracranial microhemorrhages and
      temporary depletion of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. This temporary
      depletion might transform the intracranial microhemorrhages into symptomatic ICH.

TI  - K-doped CeO2-ZrO2 for CO2 thermochemical catalytic splitting.
PG  - 39420-39427
LID - 10.1039/d1ra08315e [doi]
AB  - Green syngas production is a sustainable energy-development goal. Thermochemical 
      H2O/CO2 splitting is a very promising sustainable technology allowing the
      production of H2 and CO with only oxygen as the by-product. CeO2-ZrO2 systems are
      well known thermochemical splitting catalysts, since they combine stability at
      high temperature with rapid kinetics and redox cyclability. However, redox
      performances of these materials must be improved to allow their use in large
      scale plants. K-doped systems show good redox properties and repeatable
      performances. In this work, we studied the effect of potassium content on the
      performances of ceria-zirconia for CO2 splitting. A kinetic model was developed
      to get insight into the nature of the catalytic sites. Fitting results confirmed 
      the hypothesis about the existence of two types of redox sites in the
      investigated catalytic systems and their role at different K contents. Moreover, 
      the model was used to predict the influence of key parameters, such as the
      process conditions.

TI  - Intranasal esketamine for depression: Not so special K.
PG  - 10398562221093870
LID - 10.1177/10398562221093870 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intranasal esketamine has been recently approved for the treatment of
      resistant depression. It is the only form of ketamine approved. The formulation
      costs around $600 per dose while plain injected ketamine, on which most research 
      has been done, costs less than $20 per dose. Research shows that intranasal
      esketamine is less effective and has more unwanted effects than injected
      ketamine, yet the approval means that this intranasal formulation will now be the
      form used and researched. CONCLUSION: While the approval of an inferior treatment
      mode is understandable from the processes by which medicines are approved, we
      should think carefully about embracing this particular form of a promising
      treatment.
